Chromatin immunoprecipitation ({ChIP-chip} and {ChIP-seq)} assays identify where proteins bind throughout a genome. However, {DNA} contamination and {DNA} fragmentation heterogeneity produce false positives (erroneous calls) and imprecision in mapping. Consequently, stringent data filtering produces false negatives (missed calls). Here we describe {ChIP-exo}, where an exonuclease trims {ChIP} {DNA} to a precise distance from the crosslinking site. Bound locations are detectable as peak pairs by deep sequencing. Contaminating {DNA} is degraded or fails to form complementary peak pairs. With the single bp accuracy provided by {ChIP-exo}, we show an unprecedented view into genome-wide binding of the yeast transcription factors Reb1, Gal4, Phd1, Rap1, and human {CTCF.} Each of these factors was chosen to address potential limitations of {ChIP-exo.} We found that binding sites become unambiguous and reveal diverse tendencies governing in vivo {DNA-binding} specificity that include sequence variants, functionally distinct motifs, motif clustering, secondary interactions, and combinatorial modules within a compound motif.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The availability of multiple, essentially complete genome sequences of prokaryotes and eukaryotes spurred both the demand and the opportunity for the construction of an evolutionary classification of genes from these genomes. Such a classification system based on orthologous relationships between genes appears to be a natural framework for comparative genomics and should facilitate both functional annotation of genomes and large-scale evolutionary studies. {RESULTS:} We describe here a major update of the previously developed system for delineation of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins ({COGs)} from the sequenced genomes of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes and the construction of clusters of predicted orthologs for 7 eukaryotic genomes, which we named {KOGs} after eukaryotic orthologous groups. The {COG} collection currently consists of 138,458 proteins, which form 4873 {COGs} and comprise 75\% of the 185,505 (predicted) proteins encoded in 66 genomes of unicellular organisms. The eukaryotic orthologous groups ({KOGs)} include proteins from 7 eukaryotic genomes: three animals (the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens), one plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, two fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe), and the intracellular microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi. The current {KOG} set consists of 4852 clusters of orthologs, which include 59,838 proteins, or approximately 54\% of the analyzed eukaryotic 110,655 gene products. Compared to the coverage of the prokaryotic genomes with {COGs}, a considerably smaller fraction of eukaryotic genes could be included into the {KOGs;} addition of new eukaryotic genomes is expected to result in substantial increase in the coverage of eukaryotic genomes with {KOGs.} Examination of the phyletic patterns of {KOGs} reveals a conserved core represented in all analyzed species and consisting of approximately 20\% of the {KOG} set. This conserved portion of the {KOG} set is much greater than the ubiquitous portion of the {COG} set (approximately 1\% of the {COGs).} In part, this difference is probably due to the small number of included eukaryotic genomes, but it could also reflect the relative compactness of eukaryotes as a clade and the greater evolutionary stability of eukaryotic genomes. {CONCLUSION:} The updated collection of orthologous protein sets for prokaryotes and eukaryotes is expected to be a useful platform for functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes, including those of complex eukaryotes, and genome-wide evolutionary studies.},

Adverse drug events remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. Many adverse events are not detected during clinical trials before a drug receives approval for use in the clinic. Fortunately, as part of postmarketing surveillance, regulatory agencies and other institutions maintain large collections of adverse event reports, and these databases present an opportunity to study drug effects from patient population data. However, confounding factors such as concomitant medications, patient demographics, patient medical histories, and reasons for prescribing a drug often are uncharacterized in spontaneous reporting systems, and these omissions can limit the use of quantitative signal detection methods used in the analysis of such data. Here, we present an adaptive data-driven approach for correcting these factors in cases for which the covariates are unknown or unmeasured and combine this approach with existing methods to improve analyses of drug effects using three test data sets. We also present a comprehensive database of drug effects (Offsides) and a database of drug-drug interaction side effects (Twosides). To demonstrate the biological use of these new resources, we used them to identify drug targets, predict drug indications, and discover drug class interactions. We then corroborated 47 (P {\textless} 0.0001) of the drug class interactions using an independent analysis of electronic medical records. Our analysis suggests that combined treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and thiazides is associated with significantly increased incidence of prolonged {QT} intervals. We conclude that confounding effects from covariates in observational clinical data can be controlled in data analyses and thus improve the detection and prediction of adverse drug effects and interactions.},

(b) the likelihood that deletion of an individual gene product will prove lethal for the yeast cell clearly correlates with the number of interactions the protein has, meaning that highly-connected proteins are more likely to prove essential than proteins with low number of links to other proteins. These results suggest that a scale-free architecture is a generic property of cellular networks attributable to universal self-organizing principles of robust and error-tolerant networks and that will likely to represent a generic topology for protein-protein interactions.},

A link between the potential scale-free topology of interactome networks and genetic robustness seems to exist, because knockouts of yeast genes encoding hubs are approximately threefold more likely to confer lethality than those of non-hubs. Here we investigate how hubs might contribute to robustness and other cellular properties for protein–protein interactions dynamically regulated both in time and in space. We uncovered two types of hub: 'party' hubs, which interact with most of their partners simultaneously, and 'date' hubs, which bind their different partners at different times or locations. Both in silico studies of network connectivity and genetic interactions described in vivo support a model of organized modularity in which date hubs organize the proteome, connecting biological processes—or modules —to each other, whereas party hubs function inside modules.},

Despite decades of research, we have only a limited understanding of the genetic basis of such complex traits. Studies in model organisms have the potential to provide fundamental insights into this research area, but most genetic mapping studies in these species have had low statistical power to detect multiple loci with small effects. Using a technique in which we employed millions of cross progeny in genetic mapping, we previously showed that resistance to chemicals has a highly complex genetic basis in a cross of a lab strain and a wine strain of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Because we only examined a single cross, it was unclear how general our findings were. Here, we expand our work to all six possible crosses of four strains—the two isolates we used in our last study, as well as an isolate from an immunocompromised human being and an isolate from the sap of an oak tree. Our results based on these four ecologically and genetically distinct S. cerevisiae strains suggest that resistance to chemicals commonly exhibits a highly complex genetic basis among yeast isolates.},

Defining ways of studying biological systems on a global level, integrating large and disparate data types, and dealing with the infrastructural changes necessary to carry out systems biology, are just a few of the extraordinary tasks of this growing discipline. Despite these challenges, the impact of systems biology will be far-reaching, and significant progress has already been made. Moving forward, the issue of how to use systems biology to improve the health of individuals must be a priority. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the field of systems biology and one of its important disciplines, proteomics, will have a major role in creating a predictive, preventative, and personalized approach to medicine.

However, their number grows in a combinatorial fashion as the size of the metabolic network increases, which renders the application of {EFMs} approach to large metabolic networks difficult. Novel methods are expected to deal with such {complexity.Results:} In this article, we present a novel optimization-based method for determining a minimal generating set of {EFMs}, i.e. a convex basis. We show that a subset of elements of this convex basis can be effectively computed even in large metabolic networks. Our method was applied to examine the structure of pathways producing lysine in Escherichia coli. We obtained a more varied and informative set of pathways in comparison with existing methods. In addition, an alternative pathway to produce lysine was identified using a detour via propionyl-{CoA}, which shows the predictive power of our novel {approach.Availability:} The source code in C++ is available upon {request.Contact:} {fplanes@tecnun.esSupplementary} information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The graphical representation of the network of inferred, weighted protein interactions provides a high-level view of functional linkage, facilitating the analysis of modularity in biological processes. {STRING} is updated continuously, and currently contains 261 033 orthologs in 89 fully sequenced genomes.

However, common technologies like yeast two-hybrid may experience high rates of false positive detection. To combat false positive discoveries, a number of different methods have been recently developed that associate confidence scores with protein interactions. Here, we perform a rigorous comparative analysis and performance assessment among these different {methods.RESULTS:We} measure the extent to which each set of confidence scores correlates with similarity of the interacting proteins in terms of function, expression, pattern of sequence conservation, and homology to interacting proteins in other species. We also employ a new metric, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio of protein complexes embedded in each network, to assess the power of the different methods. Seven confidence assignment schemes, including those of Bader et al., Deane et al., Deng et al., Sharan et al., and Qi et al., are compared in this {work.CONCLUSION:Although} the performance of each assignment scheme varies depending on the particular metric used for assessment, we observe that Deng et al. yields the best performance overall (in three out of four viable measures). Importantly, we also find that utilizing any of the probability assignment schemes is always more beneficial than assuming all observed interactions to be true or equally likely.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Semantic} similarity measures are useful to assess the physiological relevance of protein-protein interactions ({PPIs).} They quantify similarity between proteins based on their function using annotation systems like the Gene Ontology ({GO).} Proteins that interact in the cell are likely to be in similar locations or involved in similar biological processes compared to proteins that do not interact. Thus the more semantically similar the gene function annotations are among the interacting proteins, more likely the interaction is physiologically relevant. However, most semantic similarity measures used for {PPI} confidence assessment do not consider the unequal depth of term hierarchies in different classes of cellular location, molecular function, and biological process ontologies of {GO} and thus may over-or under-estimate {similarity.RESULTS:We} describe an improved algorithm, Topological Clustering Semantic Similarity ({TCSS)}, to compute semantic similarity between {GO} terms annotated to proteins in interaction datasets. Our algorithm, considers unequal depth of biological knowledge representation in different branches of the {GO} graph. The central idea is to divide the {GO} graph into sub-graphs and score {PPIs} higher if participating proteins belong to the same sub-graph as compared to if they belong to different sub-{graphs.CONCLUSIONS:The} {TCSS} algorithm performs better than other semantic similarity measurement techniques that we evaluated in terms of their performance on distinguishing true from false protein interactions, and correlation with gene expression and protein families. We show an average improvement of 4.6 times the F1 score over Resnik, the next best method, on our Saccharomyces cerevisiae {PPI} dataset and 2 times on our Homo sapiens {PPI} dataset using cellular component, biological process and molecular function {GO} annotations.},

In , Snf1 is required for the response to glucose limitation. Snf1 kinase complexes contain the α (catalytic) subunit Snf1, one of the three related β subunits Gal83, Sip1, or Sip2, and the γ subunit Snf4. We present evidence that the β subunits regulate the subcellular localization of the Snf1 kinase. Green fluorescent protein fusions to Gal83, Sip1, and Sip2 show different patterns of localization to the nucleus, vacuole, and/or cytoplasm. We show that Gal83 directs Snf1 to the nucleus in a glucose-regulated manner. We further identify a novel signaling pathway that controls this nuclear localization in response to glucose phosphorylation. This pathway is distinct from the glucose signaling pathway that inhibits Snf1 kinase activity and responds not only to glucose but also to galactose and sucrose. Such independent regulation of the localization and the activity of the Snf1 kinase, combined with the distinct localization of kinases containing different β subunits, affords versatility in regulating physiological responses.},

	abstract = {Recently, a number of advanced screening technologies have allowed for the comprehensive quantification of aggravating and alleviating genetic interactions among gene pairs. In parallel, {TAP-MS} studies (tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectroscopy) have been successful at identifying physical protein interactions that can indicate proteins participating in the same molecular complex. Here, we propose a method for the joint learning of protein complexes and their functional relationships by integration of quantitative genetic interactions and {TAP-MS} data. Using 3 independent benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that this method is {\textgreater}50\% more accurate at identifying functionally related protein pairs than previous approaches. Application to genes involved in yeast chromosome organization identifies a functional map of 91 multimeric complexes, a number of which are novel or have been substantially expanded by addition of new subunits. Interestingly, we find that complexes that are enriched for aggravating genetic interactions (i.e., synthetic lethality) are more likely to contain essential genes, linking each of these interactions to an underlying mechanism. These results demonstrate the importance of both large-scale genetic and physical interaction data in mapping pathway architecture and function., Biologists are currently producing large amounts of data focused on physical and genetic protein interactions. Physical interactions dictate the architecture of the cell in terms of how direct associations between molecules constitute protein complexes, while genetic interactions define functional relationships through cause-and-effect relationships between genes. Both of these types of interactions can indicate shared protein functions; however, these two types of interactions are commonly non-overlapping, making their interpretation difficult. Along these lines, it has been noted that genetic interactions commonly occur between members of the same protein complex as well as between functionally related complexes. Here, we present an integrated framework that incorporates both types of interactions to generate large maps of protein complexes as well as highlight connections between related complexes. The ability to rapidly integrate these two types of data in an automated fashion can accelerate the discovery of new members of protein complexes as well as identify functionally related cellular components.},

	abstract = {{10.1074/jbc.M212818200} has evolved a number of mechanisms for sensing glucose. In the present study we examine the mechanism by which one of these pathways, involving Snf1, regulates cellular aging. Snf1 is a heterotrimer composed of a catalytic α subunit (Snf1p) that phosphorylates target proteins at {Ser/Thr} residues, an activating γ subunit (Snf4p), and a β subunit (Sip1p, Sip2p, or Gal83). We previously showed that forced expression of Snf1p or loss of Sip2p, but not the other β subunits, causes accelerated aging, while removal of Snf4p extends life span (Ashrafi, K., Lin, S. S., Manchester, J. K., and Gordon, J. I. (2000) 14, 1872–1885). We now demonstrate that in wild type cells, there is an age-associated shift in Sip2p from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, a prominent redistribution of Snf4p from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, a modest increase in nuclear Snf1p, and a concomitant increase in cellular Snf1 histone H3 kinase activity. Covalent attachment of myristate to the Nterminal Gly of Sip2p is essential for normal cellular life span. When plasma membrane association of Sip2p is abolished by a mutation that blocks its myristoylation, Snf4p is shifted to the nucleus. Rapidly aging cells have higher levels of histone H3 kinase activity than their generation-matched isogenic wild type counterparts. Increased Snf1 activity is associated with augmented recombination at {rDNA} loci, plus desilencing at sites affected by Snf1-catalyzed Ser phosphorylation of histone H3 (the promoter plus targets of the transcription factor Adr1p). The rapid-aging phenotype of cells is fully rescued by blocking recombination at {rDNA} loci with a allele; rescue is not accompanied by amelioration of an age-associated shift toward gluconeogenesis and glucose storage. Together, these findings suggest that Sip2p acts as a negative regulator of nuclear Snf1 activity in young cells by sequestering its activating γ subunit at the plasma membrane and that loss of Sip2p from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm in aging cells facilities Snf4p entry into the nucleus so that Snf1 can modify chromatin structure.},

	abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc13 binds telomeric {DNA} to
recruit telomerase and to “cap” chromosome ends. In
temperature-sensitive cdc13-1 mutants telomeric {DNA} is
degraded and cell-cycle progression is inhibited. To
identify novel proteins and pathways that cap telomeres, or
that respond to uncapped telomeres, we combined cdc13-1 with
the yeast gene deletion collection and used high-throughput
spot-test assays to measure growth. We identified 369 gene
deletions, in eight different phenotypic classes, that
reproducibly demonstrated subtle genetic interactions with
the cdc13-1 mutation. As expected, we identified {DNA} damage
checkpoint, nonsense-mediated decay and telomerase
components in our screen. However, we also identified genes
affecting casein kinase {II} activity, cell polarity, {mRNA}
degradation, mitochondrial function, phosphate transport,
iron transport, protein degradation, and other functions. We
also identified a number of genes of previously unknown
function that we term {RTC}, for restriction of telomere
capping, or {MTC}, for maintenance of telomere capping. It
seems likely that many of the newly identified
pathways/processes that affect growth of budding yeast
cdc13-1 mutants will play evolutionarily conserved roles at
telomeres. The high-throughput spot-testing approach that we
describe is generally applicable and could aid in
understanding other aspects of eukaryotic cell biology.},

	abstract = {Although ubiquitination plays a critical role in virtually all cellular processes, mechanistic details of ubiquitin (Ub) transfer are still being defined. To identify the molecular determinants within E3 ligases that modulate activity, we scored each member of a library of nearly 100,000 protein variants of the murine ubiquitination factor {E4B} (Ube4b) U-box domain for auto-ubiquitination activity in the presence of the E2 {UbcH5c.} This assay identified mutations that enhance activity both in vitro and in cellular p53 degradation assays. The activity-enhancing mutations fall into two distinct mechanistic classes: One increases the U-{box:E2-binding} affinity, and the other allosterically stimulates the formation of catalytically active conformations of the {E2∼Ub} conjugate. The same mutations enhance E3 activity in the presence of another E2, Ube2w, implying a common allosteric mechanism, and therefore the general applicability of our observations to other E3s. A comparison of the E3 activity with the two different E2s identified an additional variant that exhibits {E3:E2} specificity. Our results highlight the general utility of high-throughput mutagenesis in delineating the molecular basis of enzyme activity.},

	abstract = {Telomeres are highly specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that are made up of tandem 5'-{TTAGGG-3'} repeats and a number of telomere associated proteins. By forming loop structures, the very end of a telomere is concealed and distinguished from a {DNA} break, thus protecting chromosomes from end-to-end fusions, misrepair and degradation. Telomere length is maintained by an enzyme called telomerase which is very weak or undetectable in most normal human somatic cells. In telomerase-negative cells, telomeric {DNA} is progressively lost with cell divisions until the cells undergo replicative senescence, which serves as an intrinsic mechanism to prevent normal somatic cells from replicating indefinitely. In checkpoint defective cells, telomere dysfunction resulting from excessive telomere attrition or disruption of telomere structure may initiate chromosomal instability through end-to-end fusion of unprotected chromosomes. Through propagation of breakage-fusion-bridge ({BFB)} cycles, genetic aberrations characteristic of cancers, including aneuploidy, loss of heterozygosity, gene amplification and gene loss can be generated. In vitro, cells with extensive chromosomal instability succumb to crisis which is characterized by wide-spread cell death. It has been reported that cells surviving crisis either have activated telomerase, or use an alternative telomere lengthening ({ALT)} mechanism to stabilize the existing telomeres and alleviate chromosome instability. The immortalized post-crisis cells have the potential to acquire additional genetic alterations for malignant transformation. In this review, we summarize our knowledge on the association between telomere dysfunction, genomic instability and cancer development.},

	abstract = {Understanding how cellular systems build up integrated responses to their dynamically changing environment is one of the open questions in Systems Biology. Despite their intertwinement, signaling networks, gene regulation and metabolism have been frequently modeled independently in the context of well-defined subsystems. For this purpose, several mathematical formalisms have been developed according to the features of each particular network under study. Nonetheless, a deeper understanding of cellular behavior requires the integration of these various systems into a model capable of capturing how they operate as an ensemble. With the recent advances in the "omics” technologies, more data is becoming available and, thus, recent efforts have been driven toward this integrated modeling approach. We herein review and discuss methodological frameworks currently available for modeling and analyzing integrated biological networks, in particular metabolic, gene regulatory and signaling networks. These include network-based methods and Chemical Organization Theory, Flux-Balance Analysis and its extensions, logical discrete modeling, Petri Nets, traditional kinetic modeling, Hybrid Systems and stochastic models. Comparisons are also established regarding data requirements, scalability with network size and computational burden. The methods are illustrated with successful case studies in large-scale genome models and in particular subsystems of various organisms.},

Results: We present a novel algorithm for computing the probability of network interactions that operates without gold standard reference data. We show that our algorithm outperforms existing gold standard-based methods. Finally, we apply the new algorithm to a large collection of genetic interaction and protein-protein interaction experiments.

The original Dayhoff percent accepted mutation ({PAM)} matrices were developed based on a small number of protein sequences and an evolutionary model of protein change. By extrapolating from the observed changes at small evolutionary distances to large ones, it was possible to establish a {PAM250} scoring matrix for sequences that were highly divergent. Another approach to finding a scoring matrix for divergent sequences is to start with a more divergent set of sequences and produce a scoring matrix from the substitutions found in those less-related sequences. The blocks amino acid substitution matrices ({BLOSUM)} scoring matrices were prepared this way. This article explains how {BLOSUM} scoring matrices were created and how they can best be used.},

We devised a method called “affinity propagation,” which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

	abstract = {Human genetics has been haunted by the mystery of “missing heritability” of common traits. Although studies have discovered {\textgreater}1,200 variants associated with common diseases and traits, these variants typically appear to explain only a minority of the heritability. The proportion of heritability explained by a set of variants is the ratio of (i) the heritability due to these variants (numerator), estimated directly from their observed effects, to (ii) the total heritability (denominator), inferred indirectly from population data. The prevailing view has been that the explanation for missing heritability lies in the numerator—that is, in as-yet undiscovered variants. While many variants surely remain to be found, we show here that a substantial portion of missing heritability could arise from overestimation of the denominator, creating “phantom heritability.” Specifically, (i) estimates of total heritability implicitly assume the trait involves no genetic interactions (epistasis) among loci; (ii) this assumption is not justified, because models with interactions are also consistent with observable data; and (iii) under such models, the total heritability may be much smaller and thus the proportion of heritability explained much larger. For example, 80\% of the currently missing heritability for Crohn's disease could be due to genetic interactions, if the disease involves interaction among three pathways. In short, missing heritability need not directly correspond to missing variants, because current estimates of total heritability may be significantly inflated by genetic interactions. Finally, we describe a method for estimating heritability from isolated populations that is not inflated by genetic interactions.},

Whereas rad53-{TA} in vitro kinase activity is severely impaired, the rad53-{TA} strains are not completely deficient for cell-cycle checkpoint functions, indicating that the mutant kinase retains a basal level of function. We describe a genetic interaction among Rad53, Dun1, and the 14-3-3 proteins Bmh1 and Bmh2 and present evidence that 14-3-3 proteins directly facilitate Rad53 function in vivo.

	abstract = {For a number of organisms, the ability to withstand periods of nutrient deprivation correlates directly with lifespan. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We show that deletion of the N-myristoylprotein, Sip2p, reduces resistance to nutrient deprivation and shortens lifespan in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This reduced lifespan is due to accelerated aging, as defined by loss of silencing from telomeres and mating loci, nucleolar fragmentation, and accumulation of extrachromosomal {rDNA.} Genetic studies indicate that sip2[Delta] produces its effect on aging by increasing the activity of Snf1p, a serine/threonine kinase involved in regulating global cellular responses to glucose starvation. Biochemical analyses reveal that as yeast age, hexokinase activity increases as does cellular {ATP} and {NAD+} content. The change in glucose metabolism represents a new correlate of aging in yeast and occurs to a greater degree, and at earlier generational ages in sip2[Delta] cells. Sip2p and Snf1p provide new molecular links between the regulation of cellular energy utilization and aging.},

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, most genetic interactions have been measured under a single phenotype - growth rate in standard laboratory conditions. Recently, genetic interactions have been collected under different phenotypic readouts and experimental conditions. How different are these networks and what can we learn from their differences? We analyzed quantitative genetic interaction networks mapped in yeast under different experimental conditions and phenotypic readouts and found that they provide significant unique information. We next asked if this unique information is complementary. As a measure of complementarity, we asked if combining networks mapped under different experimental conditions could improve gene function prediction. Two genes that genetically interact with a similar set of genes (two genes with similar genetic interaction profiles) are more likely to be in the same pathway or complex and this can be used for gene function prediction. We found that combining multiple genetic interaction profile correlation networks using a simple ‘maximum correlation’ approach improved gene function prediction, demonstrating that the networks provide complementary information. Thus, using diverse phenotypic readouts and experimental conditions will likely increase the amount of information produced by genetic interaction screens.},

	abstract = {Measuring in a quantitative, statistical sense the degree to which structural and functional information can be "transferred" between pairs of related protein sequences at various levels of similarity is an essential prerequisite for robust genome annotation. To this end, we performed pairwise sequence, structure and function comparisons on approximately 30,000 pairs of protein domains with known structure and function. Our domain pairs, which are constructed according to the {SCOP} fold classification, range in similarity from just sharing a fold, to being nearly identical. Our results show that traditional scores for sequence and structure similarity have the same basic exponential relationship as observed previously, with structural divergence, measured in {RMS}, being exponentially related to sequence divergence, measured in percent identity. However, as the scale of our survey is much larger than any previous investigations, our results have greater statistical weight and precision. We have been able to express the relationship of sequence and structure similarity using more "modern scores," such as Smith-Waterman alignment scores and probabilistic P-values for both sequence and structure comparison. These modern scores address some of the problems with traditional scores, such as determining a conserved core and correcting for length dependency; they enable us to phrase the sequence-structure relationship in more precise and accurate terms. We found that the basic exponential sequence-structure relationship is very general: the same essential relationship is found in the different secondary-structure classes and is evident in all the scoring schemes. To relate function to sequence and structure we assigned various levels of functional similarity to the domain pairs, based on a simple functional classification scheme. This scheme was constructed by combining and augmenting annotations in the enzyme and fly functional classifications and comparing subsets of these to the Escherichia coli and yeast classifications. We found sigmoidal relationships between similarity in function and sequence, with clear thresholds for different levels of functional conservation. For pairs of domains that share the same fold, precise function appears to be conserved down to approximately 40 {\textbackslash} sequence identity, whereas broad functional class is conserved to approximately 25 \%. Interestingly, percent identity is more effective at quantifying functional conservation than the more modern scores (e.g. P-values).

Data, data everywhere. The diversity and magnitude of the data generated in the Life Sciences defies automated articulation among complementary efforts. The additional need in this field for managing property and access permissions compounds the difficulty very significantly. This is particularly the case when the integration involves multiple domains and disciplines, even more so when it includes clinical and high throughput molecular data.

{Methodology/Principal} Findings
The emergence of Semantic Web technologies brings the promise of meaningful interoperation between data and analysis resources. In this report we identify a core model for biomedical Knowledge Engineering applications and demonstrate how this new technology can be used to weave a management model where multiple intertwined data structures can be hosted and managed by multiple authorities in a distributed management infrastructure. Specifically, the demonstration is performed by linking data sources associated with the Lung Cancer {SPORE} awarded to The University of Texas {MDAnderson} Cancer Center at Houston and the Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. A software prototype, available with open source at www.s3db.org, was developed and its proposed design has been made publicly available as an open source instrument for shared, distributed data management.

{Conclusions/Significance}
The Semantic Web technologies have the potential to addresses the need for distributed and evolvable representations that are critical for systems Biology and translational biomedical research. As this technology is incorporated into application development we can expect that both general purpose productivity software and domain specific software installed on our personal computers will become increasingly integrated with the relevant remote resources. In this scenario, the acquisition of a new dataset should automatically trigger the delegation of its analysis.},

	abstract = {Abstract
The amino acid sequence of a protein governs its function. We used bulk competition and focused deep sequencing to investigate the effects of all ubiquitin point mutants on yeast growth rate. Many aspects of ubiquitin function have been carefully studied, which enabled interpretation of our growth analyses in light of a rich structural, biophysical and biochemical knowledge base. In one highly sensitive cluster on the surface of ubiquitin, almost every amino acid substitution caused growth defects. In contrast, the opposite face tolerated virtually all possible substitutions. Surface locations between these two faces exhibited intermediate mutational tolerance. The sensitive face corresponds to the known interface for many binding partners. Across all surface positions, we observe a strong correlation between burial at structurally characterized interfaces and the number of amino acid substitutions compatible with robust growth. This result indicates that binding is a dominant determinant of ubiquitin function. In the solvent-inaccessible core of ubiquitin, all positions tolerated a limited number of substitutions, with hydrophobic amino acids especially interchangeable. Some mutations null for yeast growth were previously shown to populate folded conformations indicating that, for these mutants, subtle changes to conformation caused functional defects. The most sensitive region to mutation within the core was located near the C-terminus that is a focal binding site for many critical binding partners. These results indicate that core mutations may frequently cause functional defects through subtle disturbances to structure or dynamics.},

({KMCSP)} between a given pair of nodes in a digraph in which each are is
associated with multiple quality of-service ({QoS)} metrics. The algorithm
constructs paths starting at the source and going towards the
destination. But, at each iteration, the algorithm gets rid of all paths
that are guaranteed to violate the constraints, thereby keeping only
those partial paths that have the potential to be turned into feasible
paths, from which the optimal paths are drawn. The choice of which path
to be extended first and which path can be pruned depend upon a
projected path cost function, which is obtained by adding the cost
already incurred to get to an intermediate node to an admissible cost to
go the remaining distance to the destination. The Dijkstra's shortest
path algorithm is a good choice to give a good admissible cost.
Experimental results show that {A*Prune} is comparable to the current best
known ε-approximate algorithms for most of randomly generated
graphs, {BA*Prune}, which combines the {A*Prune} with any known polynomial

To improve our understanding of this important human pathogen, the C. jejuni {NCTC11168} genome was sequenced and published in 2000. The original annotation was a milestone in Campylobacter research, but is outdated. We now describe the complete re-annotation and re-analysis of the C. jejuni {NCTC11168} genome using current database information, novel tools and annotation techniques not used during the original annotation. {RESULTS:} Re-annotation was carried out using sequence database searches such as {FASTA}, along with programs such as {TMHMM} for additional support. The re-annotation also utilises sequence data from additional Campylobacter strains and species not available during the original annotation. Re-annotation was accompanied by a full literature search that was incorporated into the updated {EMBL} file [{EMBL:} {AL111168].} The C. jejuni {NCTC11168} re-annotation reduced the total number of coding sequences from 1654 to 1643, of which 90.0\% have additional information regarding the identification of new motifs and/or relevant literature. Re-annotation has led to 18.2\% of coding sequence product functions being revised. {CONCLUSIONS:} Major updates were made to genes involved in the biosynthesis of important surface structures such as lipooligosaccharide, capsule and both O- and N-linked glycosylation. This re-annotation will be a key resource for Campylobacter research and will also provide a prototype for the re-annotation and re-interpretation of other bacterial genomes.},

	abstract = {This work demonstrates how gene association studies can be analyzed to map a global landscape of genetic interactions among protein complexes and pathways. Despite the immense potential of gene association studies, they have been challenging to analyze because most traits are complex, involving the combined effect of mutations at many different genes. Due to lack of statistical power, only the strongest single markers are typically identified. Here, we present an integrative approach that greatly increases power through marker clustering and projection of marker interactions within and across protein complexes. Applied to a recent gene association study in yeast, this approach identifies 2,023 genetic interactions which map to 208 functional interactions among protein complexes. We show that such interactions are analogous to interactions derived through reverse genetic screens and that they provide coverage in areas not yet tested by reverse genetic analysis. This work has the potential to transform gene association studies, by elevating the analysis from the level of individual markers to global maps of genetic interactions. As proof of principle, we use synthetic genetic screens to confirm numerous novel genetic interactions for the {INO80} chromatin remodeling complex., One of the most important problems in biology and medicine is to identify the genetic mutations that affect human traits such as blood pressure, longevity, and onset of disease. Currently, large scientific teams are examining the genomes of thousands of people in an attempt to find mutations present only in individuals with certain traits. Until now, mutations have been largely examined in isolation, without regard to how they work together inside the cell. However, large pathway maps are now available which describe in detail the network of genes and proteins that underlies cell function. Here we show how to take advantage of these pathway maps to better identify relevant mutations and to show how these mutations work mechanistically. This basic approach of combining genetic information with known maps of the cell will have wide-ranging applications in understanding and treating disease.},

Office information systems provide a particularly appropriate context for this type of information sharing and exchange. A federated database architecture is described in which a collection of independent database systems are united into a loosely coupled federation in order to share and exchange information. A federation consists of components (of which there may be any number) and a single federal dictionary. The components represent individual users, applications, workstations, or other components in an office information system. The federal dictionary is a specialized component that maintains the topology of the federation and oversees the entry of new components. Each component in the federation controls its interactions with other components by means of an export schema and an import schema. The export schema specifies the information that a component will share with other components, while the import schema specifies the nonlocal information that a component wishes to manipulate. The federated architecture provides mechanisms for sharing data, for sharing transactions (via message types) for combining information from several components, and for coordinating activities among autonomous components (via negotiation). A prototype implementation of the federated database mechanism is currently operational on an experimental basis.},

We present a novel approach called {TRIBE-MCL} for rapid and accurate clustering of protein sequences into families. The method relies on the Markov cluster ({MCL)} algorithm for the assignment of proteins into families based on precomputed sequence similarity information. This novel approach does not suffer from the problems that normally hinder other protein sequence clustering algorithms, such as the presence of multi-domain proteins, promiscuous domains and fragmented proteins. The method has been rigorously tested and validated on a number of very large databases, including {SwissProt}, {InterPro}, {SCOP} and the draft human genome. Our results indicate that the method is ideally suited to the rapid and accurate detection of protein families on a large scale.

Based on the premise that prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli have maximized their growth performance along evolution, flux balance analysis ({FBA)} predicts metabolic flux distributions at steady state by using linear programming. Corroborating earlier results, we show that recent intracellular flux data for wild-type E. coli {JM101} display excellent agreement with {FBA} predictions. Although the assumption of optimality for a wild-type bacterium is justifiable, the same argument may not be valid for genetically engineered knockouts or other bacterial strains that were not exposed to long-term evolutionary pressure. We address this point by introducing the method of minimization of metabolic adjustment ({MOMA)}, whereby we test the hypothesis that knockout metabolic fluxes undergo a minimal redistribution with respect to the flux configuration of the wild type. {MOMA} employs quadratic programming to identify a point in flux space, which is closest to the wild-type point, compatibly with the gene deletion constraint. Comparing {MOMA} and {FBA} predictions to experimental flux data for E. coli pyruvate kinase mutant {PB25}, we find that {MOMA} displays a significantly higher correlation than {FBA.} Our method is further supported by experimental data for E. coli knockout growth rates. It can therefore be used for predicting the behavior of perturbed metabolic networks, whose growth performance is in general suboptimal. {MOMA} and its possible future extensions may be useful in understanding the evolutionary optimization of metabolism.},

Using {HTS} data for a global survey of {sRNAs} in 26 angiosperms, elevated {GC} contents were detected in the monocots, whereas the 5'-terminal compositions were quite uniform among the angiosperms. Chromosome-wide distribution patterns of {sRNAs} were investigated by using scrolling-window analysis. We performed de novo natural antisense transcript ({NAT)} prediction, and found that the overlapping regions of trans-{NATs}, but not cis-{NATs}, were hotspots for {sRNA} generation. One cis-{NAT} generates phased natural antisense short interfering {RNAs} (nat-{siRNAs)} specifically from flowers in Arabidopsis, while one in rice produces phased nat-{siRNAs} from grains, suggesting their organ-specific regulatory roles.

	abstract = {Wnts comprise a family of secreted signaling proteins that regulate diverse developmental processes. Activation of Wnt signaling by Wnt10b inhibits differentiation of preadipocytes and blocks adipose tissue development; however, the effect of Wnt10b on other mesenchymal lineages has not been defined. To explore the physiological role of Wnt signaling in bone development, we analyzed {FABP4-Wnt10b} mice, which express the Wnt10b transgene in marrow. Femurs from {FABP4-Wnt10b} mice have almost four times as much bone in the distal metaphyses and are mechanically stronger. These mice maintain elevated bone mass at least through 23 months of age. In addition, {FABP4-Wnt10b} mice are protected from the bone loss characteristic of estrogen deficiency. We used pharmacological and genetic approaches to demonstrate that canonical Wnt signaling stimulates osteoblastogenesis and inhibits adipogenesis of bipotential mesenchymal precursors. Wnt10b shifts cell fate toward the osteoblast lineage by induction of the osteoblastogenic transcription factors Runx2, Dlx5, and osterix and suppression of the adipogenic transcription factors {C/EBPα} and {PPARγ.} One mechanism whereby Wnt10b promotes osteoblastogenesis is suppression of {PPARγ} expression. Finally, Wnt10b-/- mice have decreased trabecular bone and serum osteocalcin, confirming that Wnt10b is an endogenous regulator of bone formation.},

	abstract = {As more and more high-throughput protein-protein interaction data are collected, the task of estimating the reliability of different data sets becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we present our study of two groups of protein-protein interaction data, the physical interaction data and the protein complex data, and estimate the reliability of these data sets using three different measurements: (1) the distribution of gene expression correlation coefficients, (2) the reliability based on gene expression correlation coefficients, and (3) the accuracy of protein function predictions. We develop a maximum likelihood method to estimate the reliability of protein interaction data sets according to the distribution of correlation coefficients of gene expression profiles of putative interacting protein pairs. The results of the three measurements are consistent with each other. The {MIPS} protein complex data have the highest mean gene expression correlation coefficients (0.256) and the highest accuracy in predicting protein functions (70\% sensitivity and specificity), while Ito's Yeast two-hybrid data have the lowest mean (0.041) and the lowest accuracy (15\% sensitivity and specificity). Uetz's data are more reliable than Ito's data in all three measurements, and the {TAP} protein complex data are more reliable than the {HMS-PCI} data in all three measurements as well. The complex data sets generally perform better in function predictions than do the physical interaction data sets. Proteins in complexes are shown to be more highly correlated in gene expression. The results confirm that the components of a protein complex can be assigned to functions that the complex carries out within a cell. There are three interaction data sets different from the above two groups: the genetic interaction data, the in-silico data and the syn-express data. Their capability of predicting protein functions generally falls between that of the {Y2H} data and that of the {MIPS} protein complex data.

This method does not rely on gene sequence or protein structure homologies, and it can be applied to any organism and a wide variety of experimental data sets.

We used the method to analyze gene networks derived from genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, a large-scale gene deletion study, and from the genomic positions of consensus binding sites for transcription factors of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identified 816 functional relationships between 159 genes and show that these relationships correspond to protein-protein interactions, co-occurrence in the same protein complexes, and/or co-occurrence in abstracts of scientific articles.

	abstract = {Mutations in the highly homologous presenilin genes encoding presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 ({PS1} and {PS2)} are linked to early-onset Alzheimer's disease ({AD).} However, apart from a role in early development, neither the normal function of the presenilins nor the mechanisms by which mutant proteins cause {AD} are well understood. We describe here the properties of a novel human interactor of the presenilins named ubiquilin. Yeast two-hybrid ({Y2H)} interaction, glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments, and colocalization of the proteins expressed in vivo, together with coimmunoprecipitation and cell fractionation studies, provide compelling evidence that ubiquilin interacts with both {PS1} and {PS2.} Ubiquilin is noteworthy since it contains multiple ubiquitin-related domains typically thought to be involved in targeting proteins for degradation. However, we show that ubiquilin promotes presenilin protein accumulation. Pulse-labeling experiments indicate that ubiquilin facilitates increased presenilin synthesis without substantially changing presenilin protein half-life. Immunohistochemistry of human brain tissue with ubiquilin-specific antibodies revealed prominent staining of neurons. Moreover, the anti-ubiquilin antibodies robustly stained neurofibrillary tangles and Lewy bodies in {AD} and Parkinson's disease affected brains, respectively. Our results indicate that ubiquilin may be an important modulator of presenilin protein accumulation and that ubiquilin protein is associated with neuropathological neurofibrillary tangles and Lewy body inclusions in diseased brain.},

	abstract = {The ends of eukaryotic chromosomes have long been defined as structures that must avoid being detected as {DNA} breaks. They are protected from checkpoints, homologous recombination, end-to-end fusions, or other events that normally promote repair of intrachromosomal {DNA} breaks. This differentiation is thought to be the consequence of a unique organization of chromosomal ends into specialized nucleoprotein complexes called telomeres. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that proteins governing the {DNA} damage response are intimately involved in the regulation of telomeres, which undergo processing and structural changes that elicit a transient {DNA} damage response. This suggests that functional telomeres can be recognized as {DNA} breaks during a temporally limited window, indicating that the difference between a break and a telomere is less defined than previously assumed.},

However, most of these resources have been developed by independent groups which used different designs and different identifiers for the same biological entities. As we show in this article, incoherent name spaces between various databases represent a serious impediment to using the existing annotations at their full potential. Navigating between various such name spaces by mapping {IDs} from one database to another is a very important issue which is not properly addressed at the moment.
Results: We have developed a web-based resource, Onto-Translate ({OT)}, which effectively addresses this problem. {OT} is able to map onto each other different types of biological entities from the following annotation databases: Swiss-Prot, {TrEMBL}, {NREF}, {PIR}, Gene Ontology, {KEGG}, Entrez Gene, {GenBank}, {GenPept}, {IMAGE}, {RefSeq}, {UniGene}, {OMIM}, {PDB}, Eukaryotic Promoter Database, {HUGO} Gene Nomenclature Committee and {NetAffx.} Currently, {OT} is able to perform 462 types of mappings between 29 different types of {IDs} from 17 databases concerning 53 organisms. Among these, over 300 types of translations and 15 types of {IDs} are not currently supported by any other tool or resource. On average, {OT} is able to correctly map between 96 and 99\% of the biological entities provided as input. In terms of speed, sets of ∼20 000 {IDs} can be translated in {\textless}30 s, in most cases.

Alternative inclusion of exons increases the functional diversity of proteins. Among alternatively spliced exons, tissue-specific exons play a critical role in maintaining tissue identity. This raises the question of how tissue-specific protein-coding exons influence protein function. Here we investigate the structural, functional, interaction, and evolutionary properties of constitutive, tissue-specific, and other alternative exons in human. We find that tissue-specific protein segments often contain disordered regions, are enriched in posttranslational modification sites, and frequently embed conserved binding motifs. Furthermore, genes containing tissue-specific exons tend to occupy central positions in interaction networks and display distinct interaction partners in the respective tissues, and are enriched in signaling, development, and disease genes. Based on these findings, we propose that tissue-specific inclusion of disordered segments that contain binding motifs rewires interaction networks and signaling pathways. In this way, tissue-specific splicing may contribute to functional versatility of proteins and increases the diversity of interaction networks across tissues.},

Since laboratories began to isolate Campylobacter species from stool specimens some 20 years ago, there have been many reports of {GBS} following Campylobacter infection. Only during the past few years has strong evidence supporting this association developed. Campylobacter infection is now known as the single most identifiable antecedent infection associated with the development of {GBS.} Campylobacter is thought to cause this autoimmune disease through a mechanism called molecular mimicry, whereby Campylobacter contains ganglioside-like epitopes in the lipopolysaccharide moiety that elicit autoantibodies reacting with peripheral nerve targets. Campylobacter is associated with several pathologic forms of {GBS}, including the demyelinating (acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy) and axonal (acute motor axonal neuropathy) forms. Different strains of Campylobacter as well as host factors likely play an important role in determining who develops {GBS} as well as the nerve targets for the host immune attack of peripheral nerves. The purpose of this review is to summarize our current knowledge about the clinical, epidemiological, pathogenetic, and laboratory aspects of campylobacter-associated {GBS.}},

The performance of our best automated classifiers closely approached that of our human evaluators ({ROC} score close to 0.95). Our hypothesis is that, were we to use a larger number of human experts to evaluate any given sentence, we could implement an artificial-intelligence curator that would perform the classification job at least as accurately as an average individual human evaluator.

Alternative splicing plays a key role in the expansion of proteomic and regulatory complexity, yet the functions of the vast majority of differentially spliced exons are not known. In this study, we observe that brain and other tissue-regulated exons are significantly enriched in flexible regions of proteins that likely form conserved interaction surfaces. These proteins participate in significantly more interactions in protein-protein interaction ({PPI)} networks than other proteins. Using {LUMIER}, an automated {PPI} assay, we observe that approximately one-third of analyzed neural-regulated exons affect {PPIs.} Inclusion of these exons stimulated and repressed different partner interactions at comparable frequencies. This assay further revealed functions of individual exons, including a role for a neural-specific exon in promoting an interaction between Bridging Integrator 1 ({Bin1)/Amphiphysin} {II} and Dynamin 2 (Dnm2) that facilitates endocytosis. Collectively, our results provide evidence that regulated alternative exons frequently remodel interactions to establish tissue-dependent {PPI} networks.},

	abstract = {Explorative approaches such as {DNA} microarray experiments are becoming increasingly important in microbial research. Despite these major technical advancements, approaches to study multifactor experiments are still lacking. We have addressed this problem by using rotation testing and a novel multivariate analysis of variance ({MANOVA)} approach (50-50 {MANOVA)} to investigate interacting experimental factors in a complex experimental design. Furthermore, a new rotation testing based method was introduced to calculate false-discovery rates for each response. This novel analytical concept was used to investigate global survival mechanisms in the environment of the major food-borne pathogen C. jejuni. We simulated nongrowth environmental conditions by investigating combinations of the factors temperature (5 and 25 degrees C) and oxygen tension (anaerobic, microaerobic, and aerobic). Data were generated with {DNA} microarrays for information about gene expression patterns and Fourier transform infrared ({FT-IR)} spectroscopy to study global macromolecular changes in the cell. Microarray analyses showed that most genes were either unchanged or down regulated compared to the reference (day 0) for the conditions tested and that the 25 degrees C anaerobic condition gave the most distinct expression pattern with the fewest genes expressed. The few up-regulated genes were generally stress related and/or related to the cell envelope. We found, using {FT-IR} spectroscopy, that the amount of polysaccharides and oligosaccharides increased under the nongrowth survival conditions. Potential mechanisms for survival could be to down regulate most functions to save energy and to produce polysaccharides and oligosaccharides for protection against harsh environments. Basic knowledge about the survival mechanisms is of fundamental importance in preventing transmission of this bacterium through the food chain.},

These interaction networks represent a rich, yet noisy, source of data that could be used to extract meaningful information, such as protein complexes. Several interaction network weighting schemes have been proposed so far in the literature in order to eliminate the noise inherent in interactome data. In this paper, we propose a novel weighting scheme and apply it to the S. cerevisiae interactome. Complex prediction rates are improved by up to 39\%, depending on the clustering algorithm {applied.RESULTS:We} adopt a two step procedure. During the first step, by applying both novel and well established protein-protein interaction ({PPI)} weighting methods, weights are introduced to the original interactome graph based on the confidence level that a given interaction is a true-positive one. The second step applies clustering using established algorithms in the field of graph theory, as well as two variations of Spectral clustering. The clustered interactome networks are also cross-validated against the confirmed protein complexes present in the {MIPS} {database.CONCLUSIONS:The} results of our experimental work demonstrate that interactome graph weighting methods clearly improve the clustering results of several clustering algorithms. Moreover, our proposed weighting scheme outperforms other approaches of {PPI} graph weighting.},

The large-scale reconstruction of these networks allows the in silico analysis of cell behavior in response to changing environmental conditions. We previously published {CoryneRegNet}, an ontology-based data warehouse of corynebacterial transcription factors and regulatory networks. Initially, it was designed to provide methods for the analysis and visualization of the gene regulatory network of Corynebacterium glutamicum. {RESULTS:} Now we introduce {CoryneRegNet} release 4.0, which integrates data on the gene regulatory networks of 4 corynebacteria, 2 mycobacteria and the model organism Escherichia coli K12. As the previous versions, {CoryneRegNet} provides a web-based user interface to access the database content, to allow various queries, and to support the reconstruction, analysis and visualization of regulatory networks at different hierarchical levels. In this article, we present the further improved database content of {CoryneRegNet} along with novel analysis features. The network visualization feature {GraphVis} now allows the inter-species comparisons of reconstructed gene regulatory networks and the projection of gene expression levels onto that networks. Therefore, we added stimulon data directly into the database, but also provide Web Service access to the {DNA} microarray analysis platform {EMMA.} Additionally, {CoryneRegNet} now provides a {SOAP} based Web Service server, which can easily be consumed by other bioinformatics software systems. Stimulons (imported from the database, or uploaded by the user) can be analyzed in the context of known transcriptional regulatory networks to predict putative contradictions or further gene regulatory interactions. Furthermore, it integrates protein clusters by means of heuristically solving the weighted graph cluster editing problem. In addition, it provides Web Service based access to up to date gene annotation data from {GenDB.} {CONCLUSION:} The release 4.0 of {CoryneRegNet} is a comprehensive system for the integrated analysis of procaryotic gene regulatory networks. It is a versatile systems biology platform to support the efficient and large-scale analysis of transcriptional regulation of gene expression in microorganisms. It is publicly available at {http://www.CoryneRegNet.DE.}},

	abstract = {A computer program that progressively evaluates the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of a protein along its amino acid sequence has been devised. For this purpose, a hydropathy scale has been composed wherein the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of each of the 20 amino acid side-chains is taken into consideration. The scale is based on an amalgam of experimental observations derived from the literature. The program uses a moving-segment approach that continuously determines the average hydropathy within a segment of predetermined length as it advances through the sequence. The consecutive scores are plotted from the amino to the carboxy terminus. At the same time, a midpoint line is printed that corresponds to the grand average of the hydropathy of the amino acid compositions found in most of the sequenced proteins. In the case of soluble, globular proteins there is a remarkable correspondence between the interior portions of their sequence and the regions appearing on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line, as well as the exterior portions and the regions on the hydrophilic side. The correlation was demonstrated by comparisons between the plotted values and known structures determined by crystallography. In the case of membrane-bound proteins, the portions of their sequences that are located within the lipid bilayer are also clearly delineated by large uninterrupted areas on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line. As such, the membrane-spanning segments of these proteins can be identified by this procedure. Although the method is not unique and embodies principles that have long been appreciated, its simplicity and its graphic nature make it a very useful tool for the evaluation of protein structures.},

Our approach is based on the concept of graphs; for example, the genome is a graph with genes as nodes and the pathway is another graph with gene products as nodes. We have developed a simple method for graph comparison to identify local similarities, termed correlated clusters, between two graphs, which allows gaps and mismatches of nodes and edges and is especially suitable for detecting biological features. The method was applied to a comparison of the complete genomes of 10 microorganisms and the {KEGG} metabolic pathways, which revealed, not surprisingly, a tendency for formation of correlated clusters called {FRECs} (functionally related enzyme clusters). However, this tendency varied considerably depending on the organism. The relative number of enzymes in {FRECs} was close to 50\% for Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, but was {\textless}10\% for {SYNECHOCYSTIS:} and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The {FRECs} collection is reorganized into a collection of ortholog group tables in {KEGG}, which represents conserved pathway motifs with the information about gene clusters in all the completely sequenced genomes.},

We find transport occurs along two sets of actin cables assembled by two formin isoforms. The Bnr1p formin assembles cables that radiate from the bud neck into the mother, providing a stable mother-bud axis. These cables also depend on septins at the neck and are required for efficient transport from the mother to the bud. The Bni1p formin assembles cables that line the bud cortex and target vesicles to varying locations in the bud. Loss of these cables results in morphological defects as vesicles accumulate at the neck. Assembly of these cables depends on continued polarized secretion, suggesting vesicular transport provides a positive feedback signal for Bni1p activation, possibly by rho-proteins. By coupling different formin isoforms to unique cortical landmarks, yeast uses common cytoskeletal elements to maintain stable and dynamic axes in the same cell.},

There is, however, a third case that is intermediate to the one-sided and point-null cases, namely the interval hypothesis, that receives no coverage in elementary texts. We show that P values are continuous functions of the hypothesis for fixed data. This allows a unified treatment of all three types of hypothesis testing problems. It also leads to the discovery that a common informal use of P values as measures of support or evidence for hypotheses has serious logical flaws.},

	abstract = {The Wnt signaling pathway plays a central role in bone development and homeostasis. In most cases, Wnt ligands promote bone growth, which has led to speculation that Wnt factors could be used to stimulate bone healing. We gained insights into the mechanism by which Wnt signaling regulates adult bone repair through the use of the mouse strain {Axin2LacZ/LacZ} in which the cellular response to Wnt is increased. We found that bone healing after injury is accelerated in {Axin2LacZ/LacZ} mice, a consequence of more robust proliferation and earlier differentiation of skeletal stem and progenitor cells. In parallel, we devised a biochemical strategy to increase the duration and strength of Wnt signaling at the sites of skeletal injury. Purified Wnt3a was packaged in liposomal vesicles and delivered to skeletal defects, where it stimulated the proliferation of skeletal progenitor cells and accelerated their differentiation into osteoblasts, cells responsible for bone growth. The end result was faster bone regeneration. Because Wnt signaling is conserved in mammalian tissue repair, this protein-based approach may have widespread applications in regenerative medicine.},

Here we describe the purification and characterization of the three Snf1-activating kinases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The identities of proteins associated with the Snf1-activating kinases were determined by peptide mass fingerprinting. These kinases, Sak1, Tos3 and Elm2 do not appear to require the presence of additional subunits for activity. Sak1 and Snf1 co-purify and co-elute in size exclusion chromatography, demonstrating that these two proteins form a stable complex. The Snf1-activating kinases phosphorylate the activation loop threonine of Snf1 in vitro with great specificity and are able to do so in the absence of beta and gamma subunits of the Snf1 heterotrimer. Finally, we showed that the Snf1 kinase domain isolated from bacteria as a {GST} fusion protein can be activated in vitro and shows substrate specificity in the absence of its beta and gamma subunits.},

Although it is possible to focus on interactions with higher reliability by using only those that are backed up by two or more lines of evidence, this approach invariably throws out the majority of available data. A more optimal use could be achieved by incorporating the probabilities associated with all available interactions into the analysis. We present a novel method for estimating error rates associated with specific protein interaction data sets, as well as with individual interactions given the data sets in which they appear. As a bonus, we also get an estimate for the total number of protein interactions in yeast. Certain types of false positive results can be identified and removed, resulting in a significant improvement in quality of the data set. For co-purification data sets, we show how we can reach a tradeoff between the "spoke" and "matrix" representation of interactions within co-purified groups of proteins to achieve an optimal false positive error rate.},

Simulated annealing in turn uses a dynamic programming algorithm for correctly sampling suboptimal multiple alignments according to their probability and a Boltzmann temperature factor. The quality of simulated annealing alignments is evaluated on structural alignments of ten different protein families, and compared to the performance of other {HMM} training methods and the {ClustalW} program. Simulated annealing is better able to find near-global optima in the multiple alignment probability landscape than the other tested {HMM} training methods. Neither {ClustalW} nor simulated annealing produce consistently better alignments compared to each other. Examination of the specific cases in which {ClustalW} outperforms simulated annealing, and vice versa, provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current hidden Markov model approaches.},

We demonstrate that by combining these data with information on protein-protein, prote in-{DNA} or metabolic networks, it is possible to uncover physical mechanisms behind many of the observed genetic effects. Using a probabilistic model, we found that 1,922 genetic interactions are significantly associated with either between- or within-pathway explanations encoded in the physical networks, covering 40\% of known genetic interactions. These models predict new functions for 343 proteins and suggest that between-pathway explanations are better than within-pathway explanations at interpreting genetic interactions identified in systematic screens.

	abstract = {Gene Ontology ({GO)} has been widely used to infer functional significance associated with sets of genes in order to automate discoveries within large-scale genetic studies. A level in {GO's} direct acyclic graph structure is often assumed to be indicative of its terms' specificities, although other work has suggested this assumption does not hold. Unfortunately, quantitative analysis of biological functions based on nodes at the same level (as is common in gene enrichment analysis tools) can lead to incorrect conclusions as well as missed discoveries due to inefficient use of available information. This paper addresses these using an informational theoretic approach encoded in the {GO} Partition Database that guarantees to maximize information for gene enrichment analysis. The {GO} Partition Database was designed to feature ontology partitions with {GO} terms of similar specificity. The {GO} partitions comprise varying numbers of nodes and present relevant information theoretic statistics, so researchers can choose to analyze datasets at arbitrary levels of specificity. The {GO} Partition Database, featuring {GO} partition sets for functional analysis of genes from human and 10 other commonly studied organisms with a total of 131,972 genes, is available on the internet at: bcl.med.harvard.edu/proj/gopart.

This data along with literature-derived knowledge on regulation of gene expression has opened the way for genome-wide reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks. These large-scale reconstructions can be converted into in silico models of bacterial cells that allow a systematic analysis of network behavior in response to changing environmental conditions. {DESCRIPTION:} {CoryneRegNet} was designed to facilitate the genome-wide reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks of corynebacteria relevant in biotechnology and human medicine. During the import and integration process of data derived from experimental studies or literature knowledge {CoryneRegNet} generates links to genome annotations, to identified transcription factors and to the corresponding cis-regulatory elements. {CoryneRegNet} is based on a multi-layered, hierarchical and modular concept of transcriptional regulation and was implemented by using the relational database management system {MySQL} and an ontology-based data structure. Reconstructed regulatory networks can be visualized by using the {yFiles} {JAVA} graph library. As an application example of {CoryneRegNet}, we have reconstructed the global transcriptional regulation of a cellular module involved in {SOS} and stress response of corynebacteria. {CONCLUSION:} {CoryneRegNet} is an ontology-based data warehouse that allows a pertinent data management of regulatory interactions along with the genome-scale reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks. These models can further be combined with metabolic networks to build integrated models of cellular function including both metabolism and its transcriptional regulation.},

uses formal Bayesian reasoning to integrate heterogeneous types of
high-throughput biological data (such as large-scale two-hybrid screens and
multiple microarray analyses) for accurate gene function prediction. The
system formally incorporates expert knowledge about relative accuracies of
data sources to combine them within a normative framework. magic
provides a belief level with its output that allows the user to vary the
stringency of predictions. We applied magic to Saccharomyces

transcription factor binding sites data and assessed the biological relevance
of gene groupings using Gene Ontology annotations produced by the

Using Bayesian network approaches, we show that protein-protein interactions from high-throughput data supported by one or more genomic features have a higher likelihood ratio and hence are more likely to be real interactions. Our method has a high sensitivity (90\%) and good specificity (63\%). We show that 56\% of the interactions from high-throughput experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have high reliability. We use the method to estimate the number of true interactions in the high-throughput protein-protein interaction data sets in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens to be 27\%, 18\% and 68\% respectively. Our results are available for searching and downloading at http://helix.protein.osaka-{u.ac.jp/htp/.CONCLUSION:A} combination of genomic features that include sequence, structure and annotation information is a good predictor of true interactions in large and noisy high-throughput data sets.

We have generated a novel genetic system to study these interactions by taking advantage of the properties of the {GAL4} protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This protein is a transcriptional activator required for the expression of genes encoding enzymes of galactose utilization1. It consists of two separable and functionally essential domains: an N-terminal domain which binds to specific {DNA} sequences ({UASG);} and a C-terminal domain containing acidic regions, which is necessary to activate transcription2,3. We have generated a system of two hybrid proteins containing parts of {GAL4:} the {GAL4} {DNA-binding} domain fused to a protein {'X'} and a {GAL4} activating region fused to a protein {'Y'.} If X and Y can form a protein-protein complex and reconstitute proximity of the {GAL4} domains, tran-scription of a gene regulated by {UASG} occurs. We have tested this system using two yeast proteins that are known to {interactSNF1} and {SNF4.} High transcriptional activity is obtained only when both hybrids are present in a cell. This system may be applicable as a general method to identify proteins that interact with a known protein by the use of a simple galactose selection.},

Using a cross-genome comparison, we show that (a) the older a protein, the better connected it is, and (b) the number of interactions a protein gains during its evolution is proportional to its connectivity. Therefore, preferential attachment governs the protein network evolution. Evolutionary mechanisms leading to such preference and some implications are discussed.},

The resulting biological networks can be modeled as graphs. By means of ?omics? technologies, such as microarrays, the activity of genes and proteins can be measured. Here, data from microarray experiments is integrated with the network data to gain deeper insights into gene expression. We introduce {KeyPathwayMiner}, a method that enables the extraction and visualization of interesting subpathways given the results of a series of gene expression studies. We aim to detect highly connected subnetworks in which most genes or proteins show similar patterns of expression. Specifically, given network and gene expression data, {KeyPathwayMiner} identifies those maximal subgraphs where all but k nodes of the subnetwork are expressed similarly in all but l cases in the gene expression data. Since identifying these subgraphs is computationally intensive, we developed a heuristic algorithm based on Ant Colony Optimization. We implemented {KeyPathwayMiner} as a plug-in for Cytoscape.

	abstract = {Numerous studies in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have shown that, under standard growth conditions, less than 20\% of the protein-coding genes are essential for survival. This suggests that biological systems have evolved to have a high degree of robustness to mutational disruptions that can affect the majority of their genes. This mutational robustness could arise either due to redundancy, i.e. direct backup, or due to distributed architecture, i.e. indirect backup where multiple genes contribute to the functioning of a process in the system. Despite clear evidence for direct backup, the prevalence of indirect backup is poorly understood. In this study, we reveal the existence of a hidden distributed architecture behind the scale-free transcriptional regulatory network of yeast by applying a unique network transformation procedure and show that the network is tolerant even to mutations that disrupt regulatory hubs. Contrary to what is generally accepted, our observation that hubs can be lost or replaced in evolution suggests that this hidden distributed architecture behind scale-free networks protects the overall transcriptional program of the organism from mutations affecting major regulatory hubs. We show that the distributed architecture has been provided by an unexpectedly large number of coordinating partners for any regulatory protein. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the existence of such architecture can allow organisms to explore the adaptive landscape in changing environments by providing the plasticity required to reprogram levels of expression of specific genes that may enhance survival. Thus, an “over-engineered” backup system in the form of distributed architecture is likely to be a major determinant of the “evolvability” of the gene expression in organisms faced with environmental diversity.},

It is the leading cause of bacterial food-borne diarrhoeal disease throughout the world. In addition, infection with C. jejuni is the most frequent antecedent to a form of neuromuscular paralysis known as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Here we report the genome sequence of C. jejuni {NCTC11168.} C. jejuni has a circular chromosome of 1,641,481 base pairs (30.6\% {G+C)} which is predicted to encode 1,654 proteins and 54 stable {RNA} species. The genome is unusual in that there are virtually no insertion sequences or phage-associated sequences and very few repeat sequences. One of the most striking findings in the genome was the presence of hypervariable sequences. These short homopolymeric runs of nucleotides were commonly found in genes encoding the biosynthesis or modification of surface structures, or in closely linked genes of unknown function. The apparently high rate of variation of these homopolymeric tracts may be important in the survival strategy of C. jejuni.},

	volume = {58},
	url = {http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/content/abstract/58/2/302},
	abstract = {Protein-protein interactions are essential to cellular mechanisms at all levels in biologically responsive systems. These interactions occur extracellularly and include ligand-receptor interactions, cell adhesion, antigen recognition, and virus-host recognition. Intracellular protein-protein interactions occur in the formation of multi-protein complexes, during the assembly of cytoskeletal elements, and between receptor-effector, as well as effector-effector, molecules of signal transduction pathways. Finally, assembly of transcriptional machinery involves protein interactions. The yeast two-hybrid method is a powerful technique for analyzing these protein-protein interactions. Since the publication of this technique in the late 1980s, the robust nature and far-reaching utility of yeast two-hybrid systems for functional expression library cloning has led to the identification of many novel proteins in all areas of biological life science research. Additionally, two-hybrid techniques provide a rapid and versatile system for the further characterization of discrete protein-protein interactions. Recent variations on the basic system have enabled application well beyond protein pairs, to investigate multi-protein complexes and protein-nucleotide interactions. Yeast two-hybrid methods necessitate expression and subsequent interaction between a "protein of interest" functional pair within the yeast cell, ultimately driving reporter gene expression and thus effectively linking protein-protein interaction(s) to a change in yeast cell phenotype. Functional protein-protein interactions using the two-hybrid techniques have been demonstrated for all levels of cellular biology; however, until recently, extracellular protein-protein interactions were excluded from investigations using this technique. Investigations from several labs have now demonstrated that extracellular proteins can be studied using two-hybrid methods, thereby enabling intense study of extracellular protein partners using the robust nature and the genetic power of yeast.},

Higher-order functional cooperativity and redundancy is identified by enrichment for genetic interactions across modules. This protocol begins with importing interaction networks into Cytoscape, followed by filtering and basic network visualization. Next, {PanGIA} is used to infer a set of modules and their functional inter-relationships. This module map is visualized in a number of intuitive ways, and modules are tested for functional enrichment and overlap with known complexes.

	abstract = {Networks have in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool for describing and quantifying complex systems in many branches of science. Recent studies suggest that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, in which vertices divide into groups that further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple scales. In many cases the groups are found to correspond to known functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in biochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks or genetic regulatory networks) or communities in social networks. Here we present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network data and show that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of networks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clustering coefficients and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of hierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partly known networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than competing techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insight into many network phenomena.},

	abstract = {In proteome studies, identification of proteins requires searching protein sequence databases. The public protein sequence databases (e.g., {NCBInr}, {UniProt)} each contain millions of entries, and private databases add thousands more. Although much of the sequence information in these databases is redundant, each database uses distinct identifiers for the identical protein sequence and often contains unique annotation information. Users of one database obtain a database-specific sequence identifier that is often difficult to reconcile with the identifiers from a different database. When multiple databases are used for searches or the databases being searched are updated frequently, interpreting the protein identifications and associated annotations can be problematic. We have developed a database of unique protein sequence identifiers called Sequence Globally Unique Identifiers ({SEGUID)} derived from primary protein sequences. These identifiers serve as a common link between multiple sequence databases and are resilient to annotation changes in either public or private databases throughout the lifetime of a given protein sequence. The {SEGUID} Database can be downloaded ({http://bioinformatics.anl.gov/SEGUID/)} or easily generated at any site with access to primary protein sequence databases. Since {SEGUIDs} are stable, predictions based on the primary sequence information (e.g., {pI}, Mr) can be calculated just once; we have generated approximately 500 different calculations for more than 2.5 million sequences. {SEGUIDs} are used to integrate {MS} and 2-{DE} data with bioinformatics information and provide the opportunity to search multiple protein sequence databases, thereby providing a higher probability of finding the most valid protein identifications.},

	abstract = {A novel method to model and predict the location and orientation of alpha helices in membrane-spanning proteins is presented. It is based on a hidden Markov model ({HMM)} with an architecture that corresponds closely to the biological system. The model is cyclic with 7 types of states for helix core, helix caps on either side, loop on the cytoplasmic side, two loops for the non-cytoplasmic side, and a globular domain state in the middle of each loop. The two loop paths on the non-cytoplasmic side are used to model short and long loops separately, which corresponds biologically to the two known different membrane insertions mechanisms. The close mapping between the biological and computational states allows us to infer which parts of the model architecture are important to capture the information that encodes the membrane topology, and to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms and constraints involved. Models were estimated both by maximum likelihood and a discriminative method, and a method for reassignment of the membrane helix boundaries were developed. In a cross validated test on single sequences, our transmembrane {HMM}, {TMHMM}, correctly predicts the entire topology for 77\% of the sequences in a standard dataset of 83 proteins with known topology. The same accuracy was achieved on a larger dataset of 160 proteins. These results compare favourably with existing methods.},

Functional annotation clustering14 uses a similar fuzzy clustering concept as functional classification by measuring relationships among the annotation terms on the basis of the degree of their coassociation with genes within the user's list to cluster somewhat heterogeneous, yet highly similar annotation into functional annotation groups (Fig. 4, see slide 10 of Supplementary Data 5 for more detail). This reduces the burden of associating different terms associated with the similar biological process, thus allowing the biological interpretation to be more focused at the 'biological module' level. The {2D} view tool is also provided for examining the internal relationships among the clustered terms and genes (see slide 6 of Supplementary Data 5). This type of grouping of functional annotation is able to give a more insightful view of the relationships between annotation categories and terms compared with the traditional linear list of enriched terms, as highly related/redundant annotation terms may be dispersed among hundreds, if not thousands, of other terms.},

Analysts usually need to visit many of these bioinformatics databases in order to integrate comprehensive annotation information for their genes, which becomes one of the bottlenecks, particularly for the analytic task associated with a large gene list. Thus, a highly centralized and ready-to-use gene-annotation knowledgebase is in demand for high throughput gene functional analysis.

Description
The {DAVID} Knowledgebase is built around the {DAVID} Gene Concept, a single-linkage method to agglomerate tens of millions of gene/protein identifiers from a variety of public genomic resources into {DAVID} gene clusters. The grouping of such identifiers improves the cross-reference capability, particularly across {NCBI} and {UniProt} systems, enabling more than 40 publicly available functional annotation sources to be comprehensively integrated and centralized by the {DAVID} gene clusters. The simple, pair-wise, text format files which make up the {DAVID} Knowledgebase are freely downloadable for various data analysis uses. In addition, a well organized web interface allows users to query different types of heterogeneous annotations in a high-throughput manner.

Conclusion
The {DAVID} Knowledgebase is designed to facilitate high throughput gene functional analysis. For a given gene list, it not only provides the quick accessibility to a wide range of heterogeneous annotation data in a centralized location, but also enriches the level of biological information for an individual gene. Moreover, the entire {DAVID} Knowledgebase is freely downloadable or searchable at .},

	abstract = {The cell cycle is a temporal program that regulates {DNA} synthesis and cell division. When we compared the codon usage of cell cycle-regulated genes with that of other genes, we discovered that there is a significant preference for non-optimal codons. Moreover, genes encoding proteins that cycle at the protein level exhibit non-optimal codon preferences. Remarkably, cell cycle-regulated genes expressed in different phases display different codon preferences. Here, we show empirically that transfer {RNA} ({tRNA)} expression is indeed highest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, consistent with the non-optimal codon usage of genes expressed at this time, and lowest toward the end of G1, reflecting the optimal codon usage of G1 genes. Accordingly, protein levels of human glycyl-, threonyl-, and glutamyl-prolyl {tRNA} synthetases were found to oscillate, peaking in {G2/M} phase. In light of our findings, we propose that non-optimal (wobbly) matching codons influence protein synthesis during the cell cycle. We describe a new mathematical model that shows how codon usage can give rise to cell-cycle regulation. In summary, our data indicate that cells exploit wobbling to generate cell cycle-dependent dynamics of proteins.},

Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and {RNA} samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

	abstract = {Studies on various model systems have shown that a relatively small number of transcription factors can set up strikingly complex spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression. This is achieved mainly by means of combinatorial or differential gene regulation, i.e. regulation of a gene by two or more transcription factors simultaneously or under different conditions. While a number of specific molecular details of the mechanisms of combinatorial regulation have emerged, our understanding of the general principles of combinatorial regulation on a genomic scale is still limited. In this work, we approach this problem by using the largest assembled transcriptional regulatory network for yeast. A specific network transformation procedure was used to obtain the co-regulatory network describing the set of all significant associations among transcription factors in regulating common target genes. Analysis of the global properties of the co-regulatory network suggested the presence of two classes of regulatory hubs: (i) those that make many co-regulatory associations, thus serving as integrators of disparate cellular processes; and (ii) those that make few co-regulatory associations, and thereby specifically regulate one or a few major cellular processes. Investigation of the local structure of the co-regulatory network revealed a significantly higher than expected modular organization, which might have emerged as a result of selection by functional constraints. These constraints probably emerge from the need for extensive modular backup and the requirement to integrate transcriptional inputs of multiple distinct functional systems. We then explored the transcriptional control of three major regulatory systems (ubiquitin signaling, protein kinase and transcriptional regulation systems) to understand specific aspects of their upstream control. As a result, we observed that ubiquitin E3 ligases are regulated primarily by unique transcription factors, whereas E1 and E2 enzymes share common transcription factors to a much greater extent. This suggested that the deployment of E3s unique to specific functional contexts may be mediated significantly at the transcriptional level. Likewise, we were able to uncover evidence for much higher upstream transcription control of transcription factors themselves, in comparison to components of other regulatory systems. We believe that the results presented here might provide a framework for testing the role of co-regulatory associations in eukaryotic transcriptional control.},

Oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to positions 582 to 593 of the viral {DNA} strand of the bacteriophage {phiX174} am3 mutant ({pGTATCCTACAAA)}, and to the wild type sequence in this region ({pGTATCCTACAAA)}, were synthesized and used as specific mutagens. Each of these oligonucleotides was incorporated into a complete circular complementary strand when used as primer on a genetically heterologous viral strand template, by the combined action of subtilisin-treated Escherichia coli {DNA} polymerase I and T4 {DNA} ligase. Incomplete duplexes were removed or were inactivated by nuclease S1 and the products were used to transfect spheroplasts of E. coli. Both oligonucleotides induced specific mutations at high efficiency when used with heterologous template (15\% mutants among progeny phage). The am phages isolated by this procedure are phenotypically gene E mutants, and contain A at position 587 of the viral strand. They thus appear identical with am3 and provide evidence that the change G leads to A at position 587 is sufficient to produce a defective E function. Since the template for the induction of am mutants carried another genetic marker ({sB1)}, the strains carrying the induced mutations have the new genotype am3 {sB1.} It should be possible to introduce the am3 mutation into any known mutant strain of phi174 using this same oligonucleotide. Both possible transition mutations were induced in these experiments. In principle, the method could also induce transversions, insertions, and deletions. The method should be applicable to other circular {DNAs} of similar size, for example recombinant {DNA} plasmids.},

	abstract = {Genotypic differences greatly influence susceptibility and resistance to disease. Understanding genotype-phenotype relationships requires that phenotypes be viewed as manifestations of network properties, rather than simply as the result of individual genomic variations. Genome sequencing efforts have identified numerous germline mutations, and large numbers of somatic genomic alterations, associated with a predisposition to cancer. However, it remains difficult to distinguish background, or /`passenger/', cancer mutations from causal, or /`driver/', mutations in these data sets. Human viruses intrinsically depend on their host cell during the course of infection and can elicit pathological phenotypes similar to those arising from mutations. Here we test the hypothesis that genomic variations and tumour viruses may cause cancer through related mechanisms, by systematically examining host interactome and transcriptome network perturbations caused by {DNA} tumour virus proteins. The resulting integrated viral perturbation data reflects rewiring of the host cell networks, and highlights pathways, such as Notch signalling and apoptosis, that go awry in cancer. We show that systematic analyses of host targets of viral proteins can identify cancer genes with a success rate on a par with their identification through functional genomics and large-scale cataloguing of tumour mutations. Together, these complementary approaches increase the specificity of cancer gene identification. Combining systems-level studies of pathogen-encoded gene products with genomic approaches will facilitate the prioritization of cancer-causing driver genes to advance the understanding of the genetic basis of human cancer.},

We observe that at given levels of sensitivity, our predictions are more accurate than the existing high-throughput experimental data sets. We validate our predictions with {TAP} (tandem affinity purification) tagging experiments.

The crystal structure of 14-3-3ζ complexed with the phosphoserine motif in polyoma middle-T was determined to 2.6 Å resolution. The bound peptide is in an extended conformation, with a tight turn created by the {pS} +2 Pro in a cis conformation. Sites of peptide–protein interaction in the complex rationalize the peptide library results. Finally, we show that the 14-3-3 dimer binds tightly to single molecules containing tandem repeats of phosphoserine motifs, implicating bidentate association as a signaling mechanism with molecules such as Raf, {BAD}, and Cbl.},

Model structures, simulation descriptions and numerical results can be encoded in structured formats, but there is an increasing need to provide an additional semantic layer. Semantic information adds meaning to components of structured descriptions to help identify and interpret them unambiguously. Ontologies are one of the tools frequently used for this purpose. We describe here three ontologies created specifically to address the needs of the systems biology community. The Systems Biology Ontology ({SBO)} provides semantic information about the model components. The Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology ({KiSAO)} supplies information about existing algorithms available for the simulation of systems biology models, their characterization and interrelationships. The Terminology for the Description of Dynamics ({TEDDY)} categorizes dynamical features of the simulation results and general systems behavior. The provision of semantic information extends a model's longevity and facilitates its reuse. It provides useful insight into the biology of modeled processes, and may be used to make informed decisions on subsequent simulation experiments.},

	abstract = {In eucaryotes a cell cycle control called a checkpoint ensures that mitosis occurs only after chromosomes are completely replicated and any damage is repaired. The function of this checkpoint in budding yeast requires the {RAD9} gene. Here we examine the role of the {RAD9} gene in the arrest of the 12 cell division cycle (cdc) mutants, temperature-sensitive lethal mutants that arrest in specific phases of the cell cycle at a restrictive temperature. We found that in four cdc mutants the cdc rad9 cells failed to arrest after a shift to the restrictive temperature, rather they continued cell division and died rapidly, whereas the cdc {RAD} cells arrested and remained viable. The cell cycle and genetic phenotypes of the 12 cdc {RAD} mutants indicate the function of the {RAD9} checkpoint is phase-specific and signal-specific. First, the four cdc {RAD} mutants that required {RAD9} each arrested in the late {S/G2} phase after a shift to the restrictive temperature when {DNA} replication was complete or nearly complete, and second, each leaves {DNA} lesions when the {CDC} gene product is limiting for cell division. Three of the four {CDC} genes are known to encode {DNA} replication enzymes. We found that the {RAD17} gene is also essential for the function of the {RAD9} checkpoint because it is required for phase-specific arrest of the same four cdc mutants. We also show that both X- or {UV-irradiated} cells require the {RAD9} and {RAD17} genes for delay in the G2 phase. Together, these results indicate that the {RAD9} checkpoint is apparently activated only by {DNA} lesions and arrests cell division only in the late {S/G2} phase.},

	abstract = {Author Summary        The precise control of gene expression lies at the heart of many biological processes. In eukaryotes, the regulation is performed at multiple levels, mediated by different regulators such as transcription factors and {miRNAs}, each distinguished by different spatial and temporal characteristics. These regulators are further integrated to form a complex regulatory network responsible for the orchestration. The construction and analysis of such networks is essential for understanding the general design principles. Recent advances in high-throughput techniques like {ChIP-Seq} and {RNA-Seq} provide an opportunity by offering a huge amount of binding and expression data. We present a general framework to combine these types of data into an integrated network and perform various topological analyses, including its hierarchical organization and motif enrichment. We find that the integrated network possesses an intrinsic hierarchical organization and is enriched in several network motifs that include both transcription factors and {miRNAs.} We further demonstrate that the framework can be easily applied to other species like human and mouse. As more and more genome-wide {ChIP-Seq} and {RNA-Seq} data are going to be generated in the near future, our methods of data integration have various potential applications.},

	abstract = {To have a better insight into the molecular events involved in denervation-induced atrophy and reinnervation-induced regeneration of skeletal muscles, it is important to investigate the changes in expression levels of a great multitude of muscle proteins during the process of denervation-reinnervation. In this study, we employed an experimental model of rat sciatic nerve crush to examine the differentially expressed proteins in the rat gastrocnemius muscle at different time points (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks) after sciatic nerve crush by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-{DE)} followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry ({MALDI-TOF-MS)}, collectively referred to as the modern proteomic analysis. The results showed that 16 proteins in the rat gastrocnemius muscle exhibited two distinct types of change pattern in their relative abundance: (1) The relative expression levels of 11 proteins (including alpha actin, myosin heavy chain, etc.) were decreased either within 1 or 2 weeks post-sciatic nerve injury, followed by restoration during the ensuing days until 4 weeks. (2) The other 5 proteins (including alpha enolase, beta enolase, signal peptide peptidase-like 3, etc.) displayed an up-regulation in their relative expression levels within 1 week following sciatic nerve injury, and a subsequent gradual decrease in their relative expression levels until 4 weeks. Moreover, the significance of the changes in expression levels of the 16 proteins during denervation-reinnervation has been selectively discussed.},

The resulting data set provides the expression patterns for thousands of predicted genes, as well as known and poorly characterized genes, from mice and humans. We have explored this data set for global trends in gene expression, evaluated commonly used lines of evidence in gene prediction methodologies, and investigated patterns indicative of chromosomal organization of transcription. We describe hundreds of regions of correlated transcription and show that some are subject to both tissue and parental allele-specific expression, suggesting a link between spatial expression and imprinting.},

	abstract = {The advent of systems biology necessitates the cloning of nearly entire sets of protein-encoding open reading frames ({ORFs)}, or {ORFeomes}, to allow functional studies of the corresponding proteomes. Here, we describe the generation of a first version of the human {ORFeome} using a newly improved Gateway recombinational cloning approach. Using the Mammalian Gene Collection ({MGC)} resource as a starting point, we report the successful cloning of 8076 human {ORFs}, representing at least 7263 human genes, as mini-pools of {PCR-amplified} products. These were assembled into the human {ORFeome} version 1.1 ({hORFeome} v1.1) collection. After assessing the overall quality of this version, we describe the use of {hORFeome} v1.1 for heterologous protein expression in two different expression systems at proteome scale. The {hORFeome} v1.1 represents a central resource for the cloning of large sets of human {ORFs} in various settings for functional proteomics of many types, and will serve as the foundation for subsequent improved versions of the human {ORFeome.}},

Network connectivity was predictive of function because interactions often occurred among functionally related genes, and similar patterns of interactions tended to identify components of the same pathway. The genetic network exhibited dense local neighborhoods; therefore, the position of a gene on a partially mapped network is predictive of other genetic interactions. Because digenic interactions are common in yeast, similar networks may underlie the complex genetics associated with inherited phenotypes in other organisms.},

The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straight-forward {DNA} and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long {DNA} sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, {BLAST} is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

	abstract = {14-3-3 proteins form a family of conserved eukaryotic proteins binding to over 200 different proteins involved in nearly all cellular processes. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two genes encoding 14-3-3 proteins, {BMH1} and {BMH2.} As 14-3-3 proteins are essential in most S. cerevisiae strains, we constructed a bmh mutant with suboptimal 14-3-3 protein activity. Here, we report the effect of these bmh mutations on the proteome as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. We identified 26 proteins of which the levels increased by more than 2.0-fold and 51 proteins of which the levels decreased by more than 2.0-fold in the bmh mutant compared with those of the wild-type strain. For only 9 of these proteins, a more than 2.0-fold alteration was found at the transcriptional level. The levels of many proteins involved in gluconeogenesis, including Fba1, Eno1, Eno2, Tpi1, Pck1, Mdh2, Tdh2, Tdh3, and Gpm1, increased in the mutant, whereas the levels of several proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis and translation and heat shock proteins were lower. Our studies indicate that 14-3-3 proteins control the S. cerevisiae proteome at the post-transcriptional level, in agreement with the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to proteins involved in protein synthesis and degradation. In addition, our studies suggest a key role in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism by 14-3-3 proteins.

Many real networks have also been shown to have the small-world network properties of cohesive neighborhoods and short average distances between vertices. Although much analysis has been done on small-world networks, small-world properties have not previously been used to improve our understanding of individual edges in experimentally derived graphs. Here we focus on a small-world network derived from high-throughput (and error-prone) protein–protein interaction experiments. We exploit the neighborhood cohesiveness property of small-world networks to assess confidence for individual protein–protein interactions. By ascertaining how well each protein–protein interaction (edge) fits the pattern of a small-world network, we stratify even those edges with identical experimental evidence. This result promises to improve the quality of inference from protein–protein interaction networks in particular and small-world networks in general.},

Researchers involved in the annotation of large numbers of gene, clone or protein identifiers are usually required to perform a one-by-one conversion for each identifier. When the field of research is one such as microarray experiments, this number may be around 30,000.

Results
To help researchers map accession numbers and identifiers among clones, genes, proteins and chromosomal positions, we have designed and developed {IDconverter} and {IDClight.} They are two user-friendly, freely available web server applications that also provide additional functional information by mapping the identifiers on to pathways, Gene Ontology terms, and literature references. Both tools are high-throughput oriented and include identifiers for the most common genomic databases. These tools have been compared to other similar tools, showing that they are among the fastest and the most up-to-date.

Conclusion
These tools provide a fast and intuitive way of enriching the information coming out of high-throughput experiments like microarrays. They can be valuable both to wet-lab researchers and to bioinformaticians.},

The gene encoding α-tropomyosinslow({TPM3)} is a rare cause of nemaline myopathy, previously reported in only five families. We investigated whether mutation of {TPM3} is a cause of {CFTD.Methods} and {ResultsWe} sequenced {TPM3} in 23 unrelated probands with {CFTD} or {CFTD-like} presentations of unknown cause and identified novel heterozygous missense mutations in five {CFTD} families (p. {Leu100Met}, {p.Arg168Cys}, {p.Arg168Gly}, {p.Lys169Glu}, {p.Arg245Gly).} All affected family members that underwent biopsy had typical histological features of {CFTD}, with type 1 fibers, on average, at least 50\% smaller than type 2 fibers. We also report a sixth family in which a recurrent {TPM3} mutation ({p.Arg168His)} was associated with histological features of {CFTD} and nemaline myopathy in different family members. We describe the clinical features of 11 affected patients. Typically, there was proximal limb girdle weakness, prominent weakness of neck flexion and ankle dorsiflexion, mild facial weakness, and mild ptosis. The age of onset and severity varied, even within the same family.

	abstract = {One of the most important, but often ignored, parts of any clustering and classification algorithm is the computation of the similarity matrix. This is especially important when integrating high throughput biological data sources because of the high noise rates and the many missing values. In this paper we present a new method to compute such similarities for the task of classifying pairs of proteins as interacting or not. Our method uses direct and indirect information about interaction pairs to constructs a random forest (a collection of decision tress) from a training set. The resulting forest is used to determine the similarity between protein pairs and this similarity is used by a classification algorithm (a modified {kNN)} to classify protein pairs. Testing the algorithm on yeast data indicates that it is able to improve coverage to 20\% of interacting pairs with a false positive rate of 50\%. These results compare favorably with all previously suggested methods for this task indicating the importance of robust similarity estimates.},

We have previously demonstrated that protein-disulfide isomerase ({PDI)} together with ubiquilin are up-regulated in response to hypoxia/brain ischemia, and play critical roles in resistance to these damages. We show here that ubiquilin interacts preferentially with poly-ubiquitin chains and {19S} proteasome subunits. Taken together, these results suggest that ubiquitin could serve as an adaptor protein that both interacts with {PDI} and mediates the delivery of poly-ubiquitylated proteins to the proteasome in the cytosol in the vicinity of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.},

Many such local “application” ontologies are being built, but it is difficult to link them together because of incompatibilities and lack of adherence to ontology standards. {“Reference”} ontologies are an emerging ontology type that attempt to represent deep knowledge of basic science in a principled way that allows them to be re-used in multiple ways, just as the basic sciences are re-used in clinical applications. As such they have the potential to be a foundation for the semantic web if methods can be developed for deriving application ontologies from them. We describe a computational framework for this purpose that is generalized from the database concept of “views”, and describe the research issues that must be solved to implement such a framework. We argue that the development of such a framework is becoming increasingly feasible due to a convergence of advances in several fields.},

	abstract = {Protein phosphorylation is estimated to affect 30\% of the proteome and is a major regulatory mechanism that controls many basic cellular processes1, 2, 3. Until recently, our biochemical understanding of protein phosphorylation on a global scale has been extremely limited; only one half of the yeast kinases have known in vivo substrates and the phosphorylating kinase is known for less than 160 phosphoproteins. Here we describe, with the use of proteome chip technology4, the in vitro substrates recognized by most yeast protein kinases5: we identified over 4,000 phosphorylation events involving 1,325 different proteins. These substrates represent a broad spectrum of different biochemical functions and cellular roles. Distinct sets of substrates were recognized by each protein kinase, including closely related kinases of the protein kinase A family and four cyclin-dependent kinases that vary only in their cyclin subunits. Although many substrates reside in the same cellular compartment or belong to the same functional category as their phosphorylating kinase, many others do not, indicating possible new roles for several kinases. Furthermore, integration of the phosphorylation results with protein–protein interaction6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and transcription factor binding data11, 12 revealed novel regulatory modules. Our phosphorylation results have been assembled into a first-generation phosphorylation map for yeast. Because many yeast proteins and pathways are conserved, these results will provide insights into the mechanisms and roles of protein phosphorylation in many eukaryotes.},

Here we describe a yeast-based assay that allows many binary protein interactions to be assessed in parallel and under various conditions. This method combines molecular bar-coding and tag array technology with the murine dihydrofolate reductase-based protein-fragment complementation assay. A total of 238 protein-fragment complementation assay strains, each representing a unique binary protein complex, were tagged with molecular barcodes, pooled, and then interrogated against a panel of 80 diverse small molecules. Our method successfully identified specific disruption of the {Hom3:Fpr1} interaction by the immunosuppressant {FK506}, illustrating the assay’s capacity to identify chemical inhibitors of protein–protein interactions. Among the additional findings was specific cellular depletion of the {Dst1:Rbp9} complex by the anthracycline drug doxorubicin, but not by the related drug idarubicin. The assay also revealed chemical-induced accumulation of several binary multidrug transporter complexes that largely paralleled increases in transcript levels. Further assessment of two such interactions ({Tpo1:Pdr5} and {Snq2:Pdr5)} in the presence of 1,246 unique chemical compounds revealed a positive correlation between drug lipophilicity and the drug response in yeast.},

	abstract = {A fundamental question in biology is how the cell uses transcription factors ({TFs)} to coordinate the expression of thousands of genes in response to various stimuli. The relationships between {TFs} and their target genes can be modeled in terms of directed regulatory networks. These relationships, in turn, can be readily compared with commonplace “chain-of-command” structures in social networks, which have characteristic hierarchical layouts. Here, we develop algorithms for identifying generalized hierarchies (allowing for various loop structures) and use these approaches to illuminate extensive pyramid-shaped hierarchical structures existing in the regulatory networks of representative prokaryotes (Escherichia coli) and eukaryotes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), with most {TFs} at the bottom levels and only a few master {TFs} on top. These masters are situated near the center of the protein–protein interaction network, a different type of network from the regulatory one, and they receive most of the input for the whole regulatory hierarchy through protein interactions. Moreover, they have maximal influence over other genes, in terms of affecting expression-level changes. Surprisingly, however, {TFs} at the bottom of the regulatory hierarchy are more essential to the viability of the cell. Finally, one might think master {TFs} achieve their wide influence through directly regulating many targets, but {TFs} with most direct targets are in the middle of the hierarchy. We find, in fact, that these midlevel {TFs} are “control bottlenecks” in the hierarchy, and this great degree of control for “middle managers” has parallels in efficient social structures in various corporate and governmental settings.

Publicly available data have previously been provided in a broad array of diverse formats, making access to this very difficult. The publication and wide implementation of the Human Proteome Organisation Proteomics Standards Initiative Molecular Interactions ({HUPO} {PSI-MI)} format in 2004 was a major step towards the establishment of a single, unified format by which molecular interactions should be presented, but focused purely on protein-protein interactions. {RESULTS:} The {HUPO-PSI} has further developed the {PSI-MI} {XML} schema to enable the description of interactions between a wider range of molecular types, for example nucleic acids, chemical entities, and molecular complexes. Extensive details about each supported molecular interaction can now be captured, including the biological role of each molecule within that interaction, detailed description of interacting domains, and the kinetic parameters of the interaction. The format is supported by data management and analysis tools and has been adopted by major interaction data providers. Additionally, a simpler, tab-delimited format {MITAB2.5} has been developed for the benefit of users who require only minimal information in an easy to access configuration. {CONCLUSION:} The {PSI-MI} {XML2.5} and {MITAB2.5} formats have been jointly developed by interaction data producers and providers from both the academic and commercial sector, and are already widely implemented and well supported by an active development community. {PSI-MI} {XML2.5} enables the description of highly detailed molecular interaction data and facilitates data exchange between databases and users without loss of information. {MITAB2.5} is a simpler format appropriate for fast Perl parsing or loading into Microsoft Excel.},

However, {mRNAs} encoding the 248 amino acid nonmuscle tropomyosins and β- and γ-actin are more persistent in adult skeletal muscle than those encoding the 284 amino acid nonmuscle tropomyosins. In particular, the nonmuscle tropomyosin Tm4 is expressed at similar levels in adult rat nonmuscle and striated muscle tissues. We conclude that each tropomyosin {mRNA} has its own unique determinants of accumulation and that the 248 amino acid nonmuscle tropomyosins may have a role in the architecture of the adult myofiber. The variable regulation of nonmuscle isoforms during myogenesis suggests that the different isoforms compete for inclusion into cellular structures and that compensating autoregulation of {mRNA} levels bring gene expression into alignment with the competitiveness of each individual gene product. Such an isoform competition-autoregulatory compensation mechanism would readily explain the unique regulation of each gene.},

We establish that cell cycle arrest ofyku70Δ mutants is associated with increasing levels of single-stranded {DNA} in subtelomeric Y‘ regions, and find that the mismatch repair-associated {EXO1} gene is required for both {ssDNA} generation and cell cycle arrest of yku70Δ mutants. In contrast, {MRE11} is not required for {ssDNA} generation. The behavior of yku70Δ exo1Δ double mutants strongly indicates that {ssDNA} is an important component of the arrest signal inyku70Δ mutants and demonstrates a link between damaged telomeres and mismatch repair-associated exonucleases. This link is confirmed by our demonstration that {EXO1} also plays a role in {ssDNA} generation in cdc13-1 mutants. We have also found that the {MAD2} but not the {BUB2} spindle checkpoint gene is required for efficient arrest of yku70Δ mutants. Therefore, subsets of both {DNA-damage} and spindle checkpoint pathways cooperate to regulate cell division of yku70Δ mutants.

The {BeadArray} technology from Illumina makes its preprocessing and quality control different from other microarray technologies. Unfortunately, most other analyses have not taken advantage of the unique properties of the {BeadArray} system, and have just incorporated preprocessing methods originally designed for Affymetrix microarrays. lumi is a Bioconductor package especially designed to process the Illumina microarray data. It includes data input, quality control, variance stabilization, normalization and gene annotation portions. In specific, the lumi package includes a variance-stabilizing transformation ({VST)} algorithm that takes advantage of the technical replicates available on every Illumina microarray. Different normalization method options and multiple quality control plots are provided in the package. To better annotate the Illumina data, a vendor independent nucleotide universal identifier ({nuID)} was devised to identify the probes of Illumina microarray. The {nuID} annotation packages and output of lumi processed results can be easily integrated with other Bioconductor packages to construct a statistical data analysis pipeline for Illumina {data.Availability:} The lumi Bioconductor package, {www.bioconductor.orgContact:} dupan@northwestern.edu},

	abstract = {The tumor-suppressor p53 is a multifunctional protein mainly responsible for maintaining genomic integrity. p53 induces its tumor-suppressor activity by either causing cell-cycle arrest ({G1/S} or {G2/M)} or inducing cells to undergo apoptosis. This function of wild-type p53 as “guardian of the genome” is presumably achieved by forming molecular complexes with different {DNA} targets as well as by interacting with a number of cellular proteins, e.g., Mdm2, Gadd45, p21, 14-3-3σ, Bax and Apaf-1. Upon activation, p53 activates p21, which in turn controls the cell cycle by regulating G1 or G2 checkpoints. Here, we report {SMAR1} as one such p53-interacting protein that is involved in delaying tumor progression in vivo as well as in regulating the cell cycle. {SMAR1} is a newly identified {MARBP} involved in chromatin-mediated gene regulation. The {SMAR1} gene encodes at least 2 alternatively spliced variants: {SMAR1L} (the full-length form) and {SMAR1S} (the shorter form). We report that expression of {SMAR1S}, but not of {SMAR1L}, {mRNA} was decreased in most of the human cell lines examined, suggesting selective silencing of {SMAR1S.} Overexpression of {SMAR1S} in mouse melanoma cells ({B16F1)} and their subsequent injection in {C57BL/6} mice delays tumor growth. Exogenous {SMAR1S} causes significant retardation of {B16F1} cells in the {G2/M} phase of the cell cycle compared to {SMAR1L.} {SMAR1S} activates p53-mediated reporter gene expression in mouse melanoma cells, breast cancer cells ({MCF-7)} and p53 null cells (K562), followed by activation of its downstream effector, p21. We further demonstrate that {SMAR1} physically interacts and colocalizes with p53. These data together suggest that {SMAR1} is the only known {MARBP} that delays tumor progression via direct activation and interaction with tumor-suppressor p53. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Control sections were stained with irrelevant rabbit {IgG} or isotype matched murine monoclonal antibody ({MOPC)}, respectively. Tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and examined by light microscopy. Specific staining for {gC1q-R}, C1q, and {HK} was observed in and around atherosclerotic lesions. In contrast to control antibodies, antibodies directed against {gC1q-R} reacted with endothelial cells, foam cells, smooth muscle cells, and inflammatory cells present in the intima and media of atherosclerotic lesions. In addition, the necrotic central core of advanced lesions with calcifications, fibrin, and lipids, stained intensely for {gC1q-R}, and negligibly with control antibodies. {HK} demonstrated a similar staining pattern, whereas C1q was most heavily expressed in the fibrous cap and necrotic core of atherosclerotic lesions. The localization of {gC1q-R} and its ligands C1q and {HK} in atherosclerotic lesions, and the previously described ability of {gC1q-R} to modulate complement, kinin, and coagulation cascades, suggest that {gC1q-R} may play an important role in promoting inflammation and thrombosis in atherosclerotic lesions.},

Here, we utilize improved enrichment statistical methods and an extensive collection of functionally related gene sets, gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the progressive alterations associated with functional decline in dilated cardiomyopathy. We visualize the enrichment results as an Enrichment Map, where significant gene sets are grouped based on annotation similarity. This approach vastly simplifies the interpretation of the large number of enriched gene sets found.

The alanine scan revealed a cluster of a dozen large side chains that when mutated to alanine each showed more than a four times lower binding affinity to the {hGH} receptor. Many of these residues that promote binding to the {hGH} receptor are altered in homologs of {hGH} (such as placental lactogens and prolactins) that do not bind tightly to the {hGH} receptor. The overall folding of these mutant proteins was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type {hGH}, as determined by strong cross-reactivities with seven different conformationally sensitive monoclonal antibodies. The alanine scan also identified at least one side chain, Glu174, that hindered binding because when it was mutated to alanine the receptor affinity increased by more than a factor of four.},

Currently the scientific literature serves as the main source for yet uncurated functional annotations, but curation work is slow and expensive. Automatic techniques that support this work are still lacking reliability. We developed a method to identify conserved protein interaction graphs and to predict missing protein functions from orthologs in these graphs. To enhance the precision of the results, we furthermore implemented a procedure that validates all predictions based on findings reported in the literature. {RESULTS} : Using this procedure, more than 80\% of the {GO} annotations for proteins with highly conserved orthologs that are available in {UniProtKb/Swiss-Prot} could be verified automatically. For a subset of proteins we predicted new {GO} annotations that were not available in {UniProtKb/Swiss-Prot.} All predictions were correct (100\% precision) according to the verifications from a trained curator. {CONCLUSION} : Our method of integrating {CCSs} and literature mining is thus a highly reliable approach to predict {GO} annotations for weakly characterized proteins with orthologs.},

To test this hypothesis, we examined {miRNA} target motif occurrences in the 3â€²- and 5â€²-{UTRs} of 20\&\#xa0;527 human protein-coding genes. The results revealed that {miRNA} target motifs appeared more frequently than non-target motifs and were enriched in the 3â€²-{UTRs.} This enrichment was relatively reduced in a set of 2525 genes coexpressed with {miR-124a} in the prefrontal cortex, but still remained at a high level, suggesting that {miRNA} target motifs are fostered by some other factors that surpass the influence of selective avoidance.},

	abstract = {Cytokinesis requires the wholesale reorganization of the cytoskeleton and secretion to complete the division of one cell into two. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the {IQGAP-related} protein Iqg1 (Cyk1) promotes cytokinetic actin ring formation and is required for cytokinesis and viability [1], [2] and [3]. As the actin ring is not essential for cytokinesis or viability, Iqg1 must act by another mechanism [4]. To uncover this mechanism, a screen for high-copy suppressors of the iqg1 lethal phenotype was performed. {CYK3} suppressed the requirement for {IQG1} in viability and cytokinesis without restoration of the actin ring, demonstrating that {CYK3} promotes cytokinesis through an actomyosin-ring-independent pathway. {CYK3} encodes a novel {SH3-domain} protein that was found in association with the actin ring and the mother-bud neck. cyk3 null cells had misshapen mother-bud necks and were deficient in cytokinesis. In the cyk3 null strain, actin rearrangements associated with cytokinesis appeared normal, suggesting that the phenotype reflects a defect in secretory targeting or septal synthesis. Deletion of either cyk3 or hof1 alone results in a mild cytokinetic phenotype [5], [6] and [7], but deletion of both genes resulted in lethality and a complete cytokinetic block, suggesting overlapping function. Thus, Cyk3 appears to be important for cytokinesis and acts potentially downstream of Iqg1.},

	abstract = {14-3-3 proteins form a family of highly conserved, acidic, dimeric proteins. These proteins have been identified in all eukaryotic species investigated, often in multiple isoforms, up to 13 in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Hundreds of proteins, from diverse eukaryotic organisms, implicated in numerous cellular processes, have been identified as binding partners of 14-3-3 proteins. Therefore, the major activity of 14-3-3 proteins seems to be its ability to bind other intracellular proteins. Binding to 14-3-3 proteins may result in a conformational change of the protein required for its full activity or for inhibition of its activity, in interaction between two binding partners or in a different subcellular localization. Most of these interactions take place after phosphorylation of the binding partners. These observations suggest a major role of 14-3-3 proteins in regulatory networks. Here, the information on 14-3-3 proteins gathered from several genome- and proteome-wide studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is reviewed. In particular, the protein kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of 14-3-3 binding partners, phosphorylation of 14-3-3 proteins themselves, the transcriptional regulation of the 14-3-3 genes, and the role of 14-3-3 proteins in transcription are addressed. These large scale studies may help understand the function of 14-3-3 proteins at a cellular level rather than at the level of a single process.},

	abstract = {Cellular functions are mediated through complex systems of macromolecules and metabolites linked through biochemical and physical interactions, represented in interactome models as 'nodes' and 'edges', respectively. Better understanding of genotype-to-phenotype relationships in human disease will require modeling of how disease-causing mutations affect systems or interactome properties. Here we investigate how perturbations of interactome networks may differ between complete loss of gene products ('node removal') and interaction-specific or edge-specific ('edgetic') alterations. Global computational analyses of 50 000 known causative mutations in human Mendelian disorders revealed clear separations of mutations probably corresponding to those of node removal versus edgetic perturbations. Experimental characterization of mutant alleles in various disorders identified diverse edgetic interaction profiles of mutant proteins, which correlated with distinct structural properties of disease proteins and disease mechanisms. Edgetic perturbations seem to confer distinct functional consequences from node removal because a large fraction of cases in which a single gene is linked to multiple disorders can be modeled by distinguishing edgetic network perturbations. Edgetic network perturbation models might improve both the understanding of dissemination of disease alleles in human populations and the development of molecular therapeutic strategies.},

Through the integration of interaction data from the main pathway repositories, we provide structural details at atomic resolution for over 12,000 protein-protein interactions in eight model organisms. Unlike static databases, {Interactome3D} also allows biologists to upload newly discovered interactions and pathways in any species, select the best combination of structural templates and build three-dimensional models in a fully automated manner. Finally, we illustrate the value of {Interactome3D} through the structural annotation of the complement cascade pathway, rationalizing a potential common mechanism of action suggested for several disease-causing mutations.

	abstract = {A prerequisite for systems biology is the integration and analysis of heterogeneous experimental data stored in hundreds of life-science databases and millions of scientific publications. Several standardised formats for the exchange of specific kinds of biological information exist. Such exchange languages facilitate the integration process; however they are not designed to transport integrated datasets. A format for exchanging integrated datasets needs to i) cover data from a broad range of application domains, ii) be flexible and extensible to combine many different complex data structures, iii) include metadata and semantic definitions, iv) include inferred information, v) identify the original data source for integrated entities and vi) transport large integrated datasets. Unfortunately, none of the exchange formats from the biological domain (e.g. {BioPAX}, {MAGE-ML}, {PSI-MI}, {SBML)} or the generic approaches ({RDF}, {OWL)} fulfil these requirements in a systematic way. We present {OXL}, a format for the exchange of integrated data sets, and detail how the aforementioned requirements are met within the {OXL} format. {OXL} is the native format within the data integration and text mining system {ONDEX.} Although {OXL} was developed with the {ONDEX} system in mind, it also has the potential to be used in several other biological and non-biological applications described in this paper.

	abstract = {Orthologs are genes in different species that originate from a single gene in the last common ancestor of these species. Such genes have often retained identical biological roles in the present-day organisms. It is hence important to identify orthologs for transferring functional information between genes in different organisms with a high degree of reliability. For example, orthologs of human proteins are often functionally characterized in model organisms. Unfortunately, orthology analysis between human and e.g. invertebrates is often complex because of large numbers of paralogs within protein families. Paralogs that predate the species split, which we call out-paralogs, can easily be confused with true orthologs. Paralogs that arose after the species split, which we call in-paralogs, however, are bona fide orthologs by {definition.Orthologs} and in-paralogs are typically detected with phylogenetic methods, but these are slow and difficult to automate. Automatic clustering methods based on two-way best genome-wide matches on the other hand, have so far not separated in-paralogs from out-paralogs {effectively.We} present a fully automatic method for finding orthologs and in-paralogs from two species. Ortholog clusters are seeded with a two-way best pairwise match, after which an algorithm for adding in-paralogs is applied. The method bypasses multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees, which can be slow and error-prone steps in classical ortholog detection. Still, it robustly detects complex orthologous relationships and assigns confidence values for both orthologs and in-paralogs. The program, called {INPARANOID}, was tested on all completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes. To assess the quality of {INPARANOID} results, ortholog clusters were generated from a dataset of worm and mammalian transmembrane proteins, and were compared to clusters derived by manual tree-based ortholog detection methods. This study led to the identification with a high degree of confidence of over a dozen novel worm-mammalian ortholog assignments that were previously undetected because of shortcomings of phylogenetic {methods.A} {WWW} server that allows searching for orthologs between human and several fully sequenced genomes is installed at http://www.cgb.ki.se/inparanoid/. This is the first comprehensive resource with orthologs of all fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes. Programs and tables of orthology assignments are available from the same location.},

	abstract = {In budding yeast, two transcription factors, Swi4 and Swi6, control the expression of important cell cycle regulatory proteins (the G1 cyclins, Cln1 and Cln2, and the cyclin-like Hcs26) as well as the {HO} gene, whose product initiates mating-type switching. Both Swi4 and Swi6 are components of a protein complex that forms at a repeated sequence element, {SCB} ({SWI4}, -6-dependent cell cycle box), found in the upstream regulatory sequences of target genes. We show, by using proteins synthesized in vitro, a direct association between Swi4 and Swi6. The cdc10-Swi6 or ankyrin motifs present in both Swi4 and Swi6 are dispensable for their association, which is mediated instead by a region near the C terminus of each protein. Furthermore, we show that interaction with Swi6 is not necessary for specific recognition of the {SCB} sequence by the Swi4 protein; we propose that Swi4 is responsible for binding to the {SCB} sequence while Swi6, through its association with Swi4, regulates activity of the complex.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the developed world. The role of a homologue of the negative transcriptional regulatory protein {HspR}, which in other organisms participates in the control of the heat-shock response, was investigated. Following inactivation of {hspR} in C. jejuni, members of the {HspR} regulon were identified by {DNA} microarray transcript profiling. In agreement with the predicted role of {HspR} as a negative regulator of genes involved in the heat-shock response, it was observed that the transcript amounts of 13 genes were increased in the {hspR} mutant, including the chaperone genes {dnaK}, {grpE} and {clpB}, and a gene encoding the heat-shock regulator {HrcA.} Proteomic analysis also revealed increased synthesis of the heat-shock proteins {DnaK}, {GrpE}, {GroEL} and {GroES} in the absence of {HspR.} The altered expression of chaperones was accompanied by heat sensitivity, as the {hspR} mutant was unable to form colonies at 44 degrees C. Surprisingly, transcriptome analysis also revealed a group of 17 genes with lower transcript levels in the {hspR} mutant. Of these, eight were predicted to be involved in the formation of the flagella apparatus, and the decreased expression is likely to be responsible for the reduced motility and ability to autoagglutinate that was observed for {hspR} mutant cells. Electron micrographs showed that mutant cells were spiral-shaped and carried intact flagella, but were elongated compared to wild-type cells. The inactivation of {hspR} also reduced the ability of Campylobacter to adhere to and invade human epithelial {INT-407} cells in vitro, possibly as a consequence of the reduced motility or lower expression of the flagellar export apparatus in {hspR} mutant cells. It was concluded that, in C. jejuni, {HspR} influences the expression of several genes that are likely to have an impact on the ability of the bacterium to successfully survive in food products and subsequently infect the consumer.},

We find that in-frame mutations (missense point mutations and in-frame insertions and deletions) are enriched on the interaction interfaces of proteins associated with the corresponding disorders, and that the disease specificity for different mutations of the same gene can be explained by their location within an interface. We also predict 292 candidate genes for 694 unknown disease-to-gene associations with proposed molecular mechanism hypotheses. This work indicates that knowledge of how in-frame disease mutations alter specific interactions is critical to understanding pathogenesis.

	abstract = {Background
Large-scale studies have revealed networks of various biological interaction types, such as protein-protein interaction, genetic interaction, transcriptional regulation, sequence homology, and expression correlation. Recurring patterns of interconnection, or 'network motifs', have revealed biological insights for networks containing either one or two types of interaction.

Results
To study more complex relationships involving multiple biological interaction types, we assembled an integrated Saccharomyces cerevisiae network in which nodes represent genes (or their protein products) and differently colored links represent the aforementioned five biological interaction types. We examined three- and four-node interconnection patterns containing multiple interaction types and found many enriched multi-color network motifs. Furthermore, we showed that most of the motifs form 'network themes' – classes of higher-order recurring interconnection patterns that encompass multiple occurrences of network motifs. Network themes can be tied to specific biological phenomena and may represent more fundamental network design principles. Examples of network themes include a pair of protein complexes with many inter-complex genetic interactions – the 'compensatory complexes' theme. Thematic maps – networks rendered in terms of such themes – can simplify an otherwise confusing tangle of biological relationships. We show this by mapping the S. cerevisiae network in terms of two specific network themes.

Conclusion
Significantly enriched motifs in an integrated S. cerevisiae interaction network are often signatures of network themes, higher-order network structures that correspond to biological phenomena. Representing networks in terms of network themes provides a useful simplification of complex biological relationships.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Proteins and protein complexes coordinate their activity to execute cellular functions. In a number of experimental settings, including synthetic genetic arrays, genetic perturbations and {RNAi} screens, scientists identify a small set of protein interactions of interest. A working hypothesis is often that these interactions are the observable phenotypes of some functional process, which is not directly observable. Confirmatory analysis requires finding other pairs of proteins whose interaction may be additional phenotypical evidence about the same functional process. Extant methods for finding additional protein interactions rely heavily on the information in the newly identified set of interactions. For instance, these methods leverage the attributes of the individual proteins directly, in a supervised setting, in order to find relevant protein pairs. A small set of protein interactions provides a small sample to train parameters of prediction methods, thus leading to low {confidence.Results:} We develop {RBSets}, a computational approach to ranking protein interactions rooted in analogical reasoning; that is, the ability to learn and generalize relations between objects. Our approach is tailored to situations where the training set of protein interactions is small, and leverages the attributes of the individual proteins indirectly, in a Bayesian ranking setting that is perhaps closest to propensity scoring in mathematical psychology. We find that {RBSets} leads to good performance in identifying additional interactions starting from a small evidence set of interacting proteins, for which an underlying biological logic in terms of functional processes and signaling pathways can be established with some confidence. Our approach is scalable and can be applied to large databases with minimal computational overhead. Our results suggest that analogical reasoning within a Bayesian ranking problem is a promising new approach for real-time biological {discovery.Availability:} Java code is available at: www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/{\textasciitilde}{rbas.Contact:} airoldi@fas.harvard.edu; kheller@mit.edu; ricardo@stats.ucl.ac.uk},

	abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high‐density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix {GeneChip®} system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five {MGU74A} mouse {GeneChip®} arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike‐in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 {HG‐U95A} human {GeneChip®} arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 {HG‐U95A} {GeneChip®} arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe ({PM} and {MM)} values of these data, and examine the variance–mean relationship with probe‐level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the {PM} and {MM} using spike‐in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference ({AvDiff)} and (ii) {MAS} 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model‐based expression index ({MBEI).} The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi‐array average ({RMA)} of background‐adjusted, normalized, and log‐transformed {PM} values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for {MBEI} and {RMA)} model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike‐in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using {RMA} and attaching a standard error ({SE)} to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe‐specific affinities.},

The {RDF2} program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The {LFASTA} program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments.

We carried out a comparative quality assessment of current yeast interactome data sets, demonstrating that high-throughput yeast two-hybrid ({Y2H)} screening provides high-quality binary interaction information. Because a large fraction of the yeast binary interactome remains to be mapped, we developed an empirically controlled mapping framework to produce a “second-generation” high-quality, high-throughput {Y2H} data set covering ∼20\% of all yeast binary interactions. Both {Y2H} and affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry ({AP/MS)} data are of equally high quality but of a fundamentally different and complementary nature, resulting in networks with different topological and biological properties. Compared to co-complex interactome models, this binary map is enriched for transient signaling interactions and intercomplex connections with a highly significant clustering between essential proteins. Rather than correlating with essentiality, protein connectivity correlates with genetic pleiotropy.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The introduction of high-throughput genome sequencing and post-genome analysis technologies, e.g. {DNA} microarray approaches, has created the potential to unravel and scrutinize complex gene-regulatory networks on a large scale. The discovery of transcriptional regulatory interactions has become a major topic in modern functional genomics. {RESULTS:} To facilitate the analysis of gene-regulatory networks, we have developed {CoryneCenter}, a web-based resource for the systematic integration and analysis of genome, transcriptome, and gene regulatory information for prokaryotes, especially corynebacteria. For this purpose, we extended and combined the following systems into a common platform: (1) {GenDB}, an open source genome annotation system, (2) {EMMA}, a {MAGE} compliant application for high-throughput transcriptome data storage and analysis, and (3) {CoryneRegNet}, an ontology-based data warehouse designed to facilitate the reconstruction and analysis of gene regulatory interactions. We demonstrate the potential of {CoryneCenter} by means of an application example. Using microarray hybridization data, we compare the gene expression of Corynebacterium glutamicum under acetate and glucose feeding conditions: Known regulatory networks are confirmed, but moreover {CoryneCenter} points out additional regulatory interactions. {CONCLUSION:} {CoryneCenter} provides more than the sum of its parts. Its novel analysis and visualization features significantly simplify the process of obtaining new biological insights into complex regulatory systems. Although the platform currently focusses on corynebacteria, the integrated tools are by no means restricted to these species, and the presented approach offers a general strategy for the analysis and verification of gene regulatory networks. {CoryneCenter} provides freely accessible projects with the underlying genome annotation, gene expression, and gene regulation data.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Many} complex random networks have been found to be scale-free. Existing literature on scale-free networks has rarely considered potential false positive and false negative links in the observed networks, especially in biological networks inferred from high-throughput experiments. Therefore, it is important to study the impact of these measurement errors on the topology of the observed {networks.RESULTS:This} article addresses the impact of erroneous links on network topological inference and explores possible error mechanisms for scale-free networks with an emphasis on Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein interaction networks. We study this issue by both theoretical derivations and simulations. We show that the ignorance of erroneous links in network analysis may lead to biased estimates of the scale parameter and recommend robust estimators in such scenarios. Possible error mechanisms of yeast protein interaction networks are explored by comparisons between real data and simulated {data.CONCLUSION:Our} studies show that, in the presence of erroneous links, the connectivity distribution of scale-free networks is still scale-free for the middle range connectivities, but can be greatly distorted for low and high connecitivities. It is more appropriate to use robust estimators such as the least trimmed mean squares estimator to estimate the scale parameter gamma under such circumstances. Moreover, we show by simulation studies that the scale-free property is robust to some error mechanisms but untenable to others. The simulation results also suggest that different error mechanisms may be operating in the yeast protein interaction networks produced from different data sources. In the {MIPS} gold standard protein interaction data, there appears to be a high rate of false negative links, and the false negative and false positive rates are more or less constant across proteins with different connectivities. However, the error mechanism of yeast two-hybrid data may be very different, where the overall false negative rate is low and the false negative rates tend to be higher for links involving proteins with more interacting partners.},

	abstract = {Background:
Learning the function of genes is a major goal of computational genomics. Methods for inferring gene function have typically fallen into two categories: 'guilt-by-profiling', which exploits correlation between function and other gene characteristics; and 'guilt-by-association', which transfers function from one gene to another via biological relationships.

Results:
We have developed a strategy ({'Funckenstein')} that performs guilt-by-profiling and guilt-by-association and combines the results. Using a benchmark set of functional categories and input data for protein-coding genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Funckenstein was compared with a previous combined strategy. Subsequently, we applied Funckenstein to 2,455 Gene Ontology terms. In the process, we developed 2,455 guilt-by-profiling classifiers based on 8,848 gene characteristics and 12 functional linkage graphs based on 23 biological relationships.

Conclusion:
Funckenstein outperforms a previous combined strategy using a common benchmark dataset. The combination of 'guilt-by-profiling' and 'guilt-by-association' gave significant improvement over the component classifiers, showing the greatest synergy for the most specific functions. Performance was evaluated by cross-validation and by literature examination of the top-scoring novel predictions. These quantitative predictions should help prioritize experimental study of yeast gene functions.},

It is inevitable that many of these databases contain overlapping, related or conflicting information. Data integration methods
are being developed to address these issues by providing a consolidated view over multiple databases. However, a key challenge
for data integration is the identification of links between closely related entries in different life sciences databases when
there is no direct information that provides a reliable cross-reference. Here we describe and evaluate three data integration
methods to address this challenge in the context of a graph-based data integration framework (the {ONDEX} system). A key result
presented in this paper is a quantitative evaluation of their performance in two different situations: the integration and
analysis of different metabolic pathways resources and the mapping of equivalent elements between the Gene Ontology and a
nomenclature describing enzyme function.},

Here, wild-type and single- and double-knockout nuclear extracts from the 14-3-3 Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologues Bmh1p and Bmh2p were analyzed for similar cruciform-binding activities in relation to these proteins. The Bmh1p-Bmh2p heterodimer, present in the wild-type strain, bound efficiently to cruciform-containing {DNA} in a structure-specific manner because cruciform {DNA} efficiently competed with the formation of the complex, whereas linear {DNA} did not. In contrast, the band-shift ability of the Bmh1p-Bmh1p and Bmh2p-Bmh2p homodimers present in the bmh2(-) and bmh1(-) single-knockout cells, respectively, was reduced by approximately 93 and 82\%, respectively. The 14-3-3 plant homologue {GF14} was also able to bind to cruciform {DNA}, suggesting that cruciform-binding activity is a common feature of the family of 14-3-3 proteins across species. Bmh1p and Bmh2p were found to associate in vivo with the yeast autonomous replication sequence {ARS307}, as assayed by formaldehyde cross-linking, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-{Bmh1p/Bmh2p} antibody and conventional {PCR.} In agreement with the finding of an association of Bmh1p and Bmh2p with {ARS307}, another immunoprecipitation experiment using {2D3}, an anti-cruciform {DNA} monoclonal antibody, revealed the presence of cruciform-containing {DNA} in {ARS307.}},

The usual practice is to average the duplicate or triplicate results for each probe before assessing differential expression. This results in the loss of valuable information about genewise {variability.Results:} A method is proposed for extracting more information from within-array replicate spots in microarray experiments by estimating the strength of the correlation between them. The method involves fitting separate linear models to the expression data for each gene but with a common value for the between-replicate correlation. The method greatly improves the precision with which the genewise variances are estimated and thereby improves inference methods designed to identify differentially expressed genes. The method may be combined with empirical Bayes methods for moderating the genewise variances between genes. The method is validated using data from a microarray experiment involving calibration and ratio control spots in conjunction with spiked-in {RNA.} Comparing results for calibration and ratio control spots shows that the common correlation method results in substantially better discrimination of differentially expressed genes from those which are not. The spike-in experiment also confirms that the results may be further improved by empirical Bayes smoothing of the variances when the sample size is {small.Availability:} The methodology is implemented in the limma software package for R, available from the {CRAN} repository http://www.r-{project.orgContact:} smyth@wehi.edu.au},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique to help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally, the number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes in the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal. {PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS} To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed {"Enrichment} Map", a network-based visualization method for gene-set enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a network, where each set is a node and edges represent gene overlap between sets. Automated network layout groups related gene-sets into network clusters, enabling the user to quickly identify the major enriched functional themes and more easily interpret the enrichment results. {CONCLUSIONS} Enrichment Map is a significant advance in the interpretation of enrichment analysis. Any research project that generates a list of genes can take advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment Map is implemented as a freely available and user friendly plug-in for the Cytoscape network visualization software ({http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap/).}},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Data from large-scale protein interaction screens for humans and model eukaryotes have been invaluable for developing systems-level models of biological processes. Despite this value, only a limited amount of interaction data is available for prokaryotes. Here we report the systematic identification of protein interactions for the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni, a food-borne pathogen and a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. {RESULTS:} Using high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screens we detected and reproduced 11,687 interactions. The resulting interaction map includes 80\% of the predicted C. jejuni {NCTC11168} proteins and places a large number of poorly characterized proteins into networks that provide initial clues about their functions. We used the map to identify a number of conserved subnetworks by comparison to protein networks from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also demonstrate the value of the interactome data for mapping biological pathways by identifying the C. jejuni chemotaxis pathway. Finally, the interaction map also includes a large subnetwork of putative essential genes that may be used to identify potential new antimicrobial drug targets for C. jejuni and related organisms. {CONCLUSION:} The C. jejuni protein interaction map is one of the most comprehensive yet determined for a free-living organism and nearly doubles the binary interactions available for the prokaryotic kingdom. This high level of coverage facilitates pathway mapping and function prediction for a large number of C. jejuni proteins as well as orthologous proteins from other organisms. The broad coverage also facilitates cross-species comparisons for the identification of evolutionarily conserved subnetworks of protein interactions.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The epidemiology of travel-associated campylobacteriosis is still largely unclear, and various known risk factors could only explain limited proportions of the recorded cases. {METHODS:} Using data from 28,704 notifications of travel-associated campylobacteriosis in Sweden 1997 to 2003 and travel patterns of 16,255 Swedish residents with overnight travel abroad in the same years, we analysed risks for travel-associated campylobacteriosis in 19 regions of the world, and looked into the seasonality of the disease in each of these regions. {RESULTS:} The highest risk was seen in returning travellers from the Indian subcontinent (1,253/100,000 travellers), and the lowest in travellers from the other Nordic countries (3/100,000 travellers). In Africa, large differences in risk between regions were noted, with 502 /100,000 in travellers from East Africa, compared to 76/100,00 from West Africa and 50/100,000 from Central Africa. A distinct seasonal pattern was seen in all temperate regions with peaks in the summer, while no or less distinct seasonality was seen in tropical regions. In travellers to the tropics, the highest risk was seen in children below the age of six. {CONCLUSIONS:} Data on infections in returning travellers together with good denominator data could provide comparable data on travel risks in various regions of the world.},

Consequently, several large-scale interactome mapping projects have been undertaken, and protein-protein interactions are being distilled into databases through literature curation; yet protein-protein interaction data are still far from comprehensive, even in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Estimating the interactome size is important for evaluating the completeness of current datasets, in order to measure the remaining efforts that are {required.RESULTS:We} examined the yeast interactome from a new perspective, by taking into account how thoroughly proteins have been studied. We discovered that the set of literature-curated protein-protein interactions is qualitatively different when restricted to proteins that have received extensive attention from the scientific community. In particular, these interactions are less often supported by yeast two-hybrid, and more often by more complex experiments such as biochemical activity assays. Our analysis showed that high-throughput and literature-curated interactome datasets are more correlated than commonly assumed, but that this bias can be corrected for by focusing on well-studied proteins. We thus propose a simple and reliable method to estimate the size of an interactome, combining literature-curated data involving well-studied proteins with high-throughput data. It yields an estimate of at least 37, 600 direct physical protein-protein interactions in S. {cerevisiae.CONCLUSIONS:Our} method leads to higher and more accurate estimates of the interactome size, as it accounts for interactions that are genuine yet difficult to detect with commonly-used experimental assays. This shows that we are even further from completing the yeast interactome map than previously expected.},

The ability to sequence genomes has far outstripped approaches for deciphering the information they encode. Here we present a suite of techniques, based on ribosome profiling (the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected {mRNA} fragments), to provide genome-wide maps of protein synthesis as well as a pulse-chase strategy for determining rates of translation elongation. We exploit the propensity of harringtonine to cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation together with a machine learning algorithm to define protein products systematically. Analysis of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause sites and unannotated translation products. These include amino-terminal extensions and truncations and upstream open reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated at both {AUG} and non-{AUG} codons, whose translation changes after differentiation. We also define a class of short, polycistronic ribosome-associated coding {RNAs} ({sprcRNAs)} that encode small proteins. Our studies reveal an unanticipated complexity to mammalian proteomes.},

We processed 1,739 genes, including 1,143 human orthologues of relevance to human biology, and purified 589 protein assemblies. Bioinformatic analysis of these assemblies defined 232 distinct multiprotein complexes and proposed new cellular roles for 344 proteins, including 231 proteins with no previous functional annotation. Comparison of yeast and human complexes showed that conservation across species extends from single proteins to their molecular environment. Our analysis provides an outline of the eukaryotic proteome as a network of protein complexes at a level of organization beyond binary interactions.

We developed a new experimental strategy called the ‘absence of interference’ approach to determine surface residues involved in protein–protein interaction of established yeast two-hybrid pairs of interacting proteins. One of the proteins is subjected to high-level randomization by error-prone {PCR.} The resulting library is selected by yeast two-hybrid system for interacting clones that are isolated and sequenced. The interaction region can be identified by an absence or depletion of mutations. For data analysis and presentation, we developed a Web interface that analyzes the mutational spectrum and displays the mutational frequency on the surface of the structure (or a structural model) of the randomized protein†.†http://biochem.jacobs-university.de/prima/  Additionally, this interface might be of use for the display of mutational distributions determined by other types of random mutagenesis experiments. We applied the approach to map the interface of the catalytic domain of the {DNA} methyltransferase Dnmt3a with its regulatory factor {Dnmt3L.} Dnmt3a was randomized with high mutational load. A total of 76 interacting clones were isolated and sequenced, and 648 mutations were identified. The mutational pattern allowed to identify a unique interaction region on the surface of Dnmt3a, which comprises about 500–600 Å2. The results were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and structural analysis. The absence-of-interference approach will allow high-throughput mapping of protein interaction sites suitable for functional studies and protein docking.},

In yeast, the {SNF1} kinase has a central role in the response to glucose starvation. {SNF1} is associated with its activating subunit, {SNF4}, and other proteins in complexes. Using the two-hybrid system, we show that interaction between {SNF1} and {SNF4} is strongly regulated by the glucose signal. Moreover, this interaction is appropriately affected by mutations in regulators, including protein phosphatase 1. We show that {SNF4} binds to the {SNF1} regulatory domain in low glucose, whereas in high glucose the regulatory domain binds to the kinase domain of {SNF1} itself. Genetic analysis further suggests that the {SNF1} regulatory domain autoinhibits the kinase activity and that in low glucose {SNF4} antagonizes this inhibition. Finally, these interactions have been conserved from yeast to plants, indicating that homologs of the {SNF1} kinase complex respond to regulatory signals by analogous mechanisms.},

It is little understood that Bayesian methods have a data-based core, which can be used as a calculus of evidence. This core is the Bayes factor, which in its simplest form is also called a likelihood ratio. The minimum Bayes factor is objective and can be used in lieu of the P value as a measure of the evidential strength. Unlike P values, Bayes factors have a sound theoretical foundation and an interpretation that allows their use in both inference and decision making. Bayes factors show that P values greatly overstate the evidence against the null hypothesis. Most important, Bayes factors require the addition of background knowledge to be transformed into inferences--probabilities that a given conclusion is right or wrong. They make the distinction clear between experimental evidence and inferential conclusions while providing a framework in which to combine prior with current evidence.},

	abstract = {Background
Comparison of large protein datasets has become a standard task in bioinformatics. Typically researchers wish to know whether one group of proteins is significantly enriched in certain annotation attributes or sequence properties compared to another group, and whether this enrichment is statistically significant. In order to conduct such comparisons it is often required to integrate molecular sequence data and experimental information from disparate incompatible sources. While many specialized programs exist for comparisons of this kind in individual problem domains, such as expression data analysis, no generic software solution capable of addressing a wide spectrum of routine tasks in comparative proteomics is currently available.

Results
{PROMPT} is a comprehensive bioinformatics software environment which enables the user to compare arbitrary protein sequence sets, revealing statistically significant differences in their annotation features. It allows automatic retrieval and integration of data from a multitude of molecular biological databases as well as from a custom {XML} format. Similarity-based mapping of sequence {IDs} makes it possible to link experimental information obtained from different sources despite discrepancies in gene identifiers and minor sequence variation. {PROMPT} provides a full set of statistical procedures to address the following four use cases: i) comparison of the frequencies of categorical annotations between two sets, ii) enrichment of nominal features in one set with respect to another one, iii) comparison of numeric distributions, and iv) correlation of numeric variables. Analysis results can be visualized in the form of plots and spreadsheets and exported in various formats, including Microsoft Excel.

Conclusion
{PROMPT} is a versatile, platform-independent, easily expandable, stand-alone application designed to be a practical workhorse in analysing and mining protein sequences and associated annotation. The availability of the Java Application Programming Interface and scripting capabilities on one hand, and the intuitive Graphical User Interface with context-sensitive help system on the other, make it equally accessible to professional bioinformaticians and biologically-oriented users. {PROMPT} is freely available for academic users from .},

	abstract = {We present a large-scale approach to investigate the functional consequences of sequence variation in a protein. The approach entails the display of hundreds of thousands of protein variants, moderate selection for activity and high-throughput {DNA} sequencing to quantify the performance of each variant. Using this strategy, we tracked the performance of {\textgreater}600,000 variants of a human {WW} domain after three and six rounds of selection by phage display for binding to its peptide ligand. Binding properties of these variants defined a high-resolution map of mutational preference across the {WW} domain; each position had unique features that could not be captured by a few representative mutations. Our approach could be applied to many in vitro or in vivo protein assays, providing a general means for understanding how protein function relates to sequence.},
